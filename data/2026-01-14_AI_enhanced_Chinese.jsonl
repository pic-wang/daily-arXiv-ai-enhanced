Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training.

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe.

In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $\u03b5$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $\u03b5$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers.

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph.

However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality.

To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure.

Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours.

Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level.

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories.

In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting.

Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability.

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models.

By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments.

Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation.

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs.

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Using a multi-label classification framework to evaluate unsupervised feature selection reveals that single-label based rankings are biased; on 21 datasets, method rankings differ from traditional single-label results, suggesting multi-label evaluation for fair comparisons.", "motivation": "Single-label evaluation on features chosen from multi-label data can be arbitrary depending on which label is selected, leading to inconsistent and potentially biased method rankings.", "method": "Assess representative unsupervised feature selection methods on 21 multi-label datasets under a multi-label classification setting, and compare the resulting rankings to those obtained under single-label evaluation.", "result": "Rankings of methods differ markedly between multi-label and single-label evaluations; multi-label evaluation can change which methods appear superior, indicating that single-label accuracy is not a reliable discriminative measure in unsupervised feature selection.", "conclusion": "Adopt multi-label evaluation frameworks to fairly and reliably compare unsupervised feature selection methods in multi-label data contexts."}}

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) \u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5728 Queries/Keys \u8fd1\u4f3c rank-one \u4e14 RoPE \u4ee5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u4e3a\u4e3b\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6cbf \u0394 \u5b50\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u8de8 token \u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a SDHs \u7684\u5185\u5728\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "1) \u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90 LLMs \u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf SDHs \u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2) \u5206\u6790 Queries\u3001Keys \u4e0e RoPE \u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6761\u5173\u952e\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b3) \u5efa\u7acb\u7b80\u5316 Transformer + RoPE \u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0 SDHs\uff1b4) \u8ba8\u8bba SDHs \u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u6761\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a1) Queries \u4e0e Keys \u8fd1\u4f3c rank-one\uff1b2) RoPE \u7684\u9891\u8c31\u4ee5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e3b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4f7f\u5f97 token \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3b\u8981\u7531 RoPE \u7684\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4 SDHs \u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d45\u5c42 Transformer \u4e5f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f SDHs\uff0c\u4e14 SDHs \u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230 out-of-distribution \u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "SDHs \u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u80fd\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u884c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORBIT \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0 LRMs \u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 on-policy \u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6bcf\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u660e\u786e\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06 frontier \u653f\u7b56\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5411\u957f\u5f62\u5f0f\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e76\u975e\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6309\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 worst-case \u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e86\u6210\u672c-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ORBIT\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u84b8\u998f\uff08on-policy distillation\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u878d\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2) \u5404\u6a21\u5f0f\u5185\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u4e14\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3) \u5c06 frontier \u7b56\u7565\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ORBIT \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks.

This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision.

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks.

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.\n  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning.

We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations.

This work introduces a soft partition--based Kernel-Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (KAPI-ELM), a deterministic low-dimensional parameterization in which smooth partition lengths jointly control collocation centers and Gaussian kernel widths, enabling continuous coarse-to-fine resolution without Fourier features, random sampling, or hard domain interfaces. A signed-distance-based weighting further stabilizes least-squares learning on irregular geometries. Across eight benchmarks--including oscillatory ODEs, high-frequency Poisson equations, irregular-shaped domains, and stiff singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems-the proposed method matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) variants while using only a single linear solve. Although demonstrated on steady linear PDEs, the results show that soft-partition kernel adaptation provides a fast, architecture-free approach for multiscale PDEs with broad potential for future physics-informed modeling.

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones.

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06 CLASSIX \u805a\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c Tanimoto \u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6539\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8303\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u7ec8\u6b62\uff1b\u5728 Tanimoto \u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5316\u5b66\u6307\u7eb9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLASSIX Tanimoto \u5206\u522b\u6bd4 Taylor-Butina \u5feb\u7ea6 30 \u500d\u3001\u6bd4 DBSCAN \u5feb\u7ea6 80 \u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u7c07\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5316\u5b66\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u539f\u672c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u601d\u8def\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u672c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u622a\u65ad\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u601d\u8def\u6539\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5411\u91cf\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u641c\u7d22\u7ec8\u6b62\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9 Tanimoto \u8ddd\u79bb\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u9510\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5316\u5b66\u6307\u7eb9\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u6307\u7eb9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCLASSIX Tanimoto \u76f8\u8f83 Taylor-Butina \u7ea6\u5feb 30 \u500d\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83 DBSCAN \u7ea6\u5feb 80 \u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "CLASSIX \u7684\u6392\u5e8f-\u622a\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f Tanimoto \u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u754c\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7c07\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u601d\u8def\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
