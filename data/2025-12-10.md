### [1] [Softly Symbolifying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07875)
*James Bagrow,Josh Bongard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2KAN 将符号原语直接引入训练，通过可微分的门控实现稀疏化，使得在需要时具备可解释性形式，且在无法用符号表示时退化为密集样条。实现了在更小模型下与基准对比/超越的性能，并出现自发的稀疏化现象。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前的 Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）在学习的激活函数往往缺乏符号可解释性的问题：希望通过引入符号原语并保持端到端可微，以实现可解释且高效的模型。

Method: 在激活中引入一个符号与密集项的词典，并通过可学习的门控实现稀释表示；稀疏化过程可微，受一个基于最小描述长度（MDL）的目标约束驱动，从而在需要时呈现可解释符号形式，否者退化为密集样条。

Result: 在符号基准、动力系统预测和真实世界任务中，模型在显著更小的规模下达到竞争或更优的准确性；并且观察到在没有正则化的情况下也出现自发的稀疏化现象。

Conclusion: S2KAN 将符号原语与 KANs 结合，提供一种在保持性能的同时获得可解释性表达的路径；当符号不足以表达时，模型自然退化为密集表示。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.

Abstract: We present a Fourier-enhanced recurrent neural network (RNN) for downscaling electrical loads. The model combines (i) a recurrent backbone driven by low-resolution inputs, (ii) explicit Fourier seasonal embeddings fused in latent space, and (iii) a self-attention layer that captures dependencies among high-resolution components within each period. Across four PJM territories, the approach yields RMSE lower and flatter horizon-wise than classical Prophet baselines (with and without seasonality/LAA) and than RNN ablations without attention or Fourier features.

Abstract: Scaling attention faces a critical bottleneck: the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ quadratic computational cost of softmax attention, which limits its application in long-sequence domains. While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.

Abstract: We study the expressivity of one-dimensional (1D) ReLU deep neural networks through the lens of their linear regions. For randomly initialized, fully connected 1D ReLU networks (He scaling with nonzero bias) in the infinite-width limit, we prove that the expected number of linear regions grows as $\sum_{i = 1}^L n_i + \mathop{o}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^L{n_i}\right) + 1$, where $n_\ell$ denotes the number of neurons in the $\ell$-th hidden layer. We also propose a function-adaptive notion of sparsity that compares the expected regions used by the network to the minimal number needed to approximate a target within a fixed tolerance.

Abstract: Datasets may contain observations with multiple labels. If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories.

Abstract: Recent work \cite{arifgroup} introduced Federated Proximal Gradient \textbf{(\texttt{FedProxGrad})} for solving non-convex composite optimization problems in group fair federated learning. However, the original analysis established convergence only to a \textit{noise-dominated neighborhood of stationarity}, with explicit dependence on a variance-induced noise floor. In this work, we provide an improved asymptotic convergence analysis for a generalized \texttt{FedProxGrad}-type analytical framework with inexact local proximal solutions and explicit fairness regularization. We call this extended analytical framework \textbf{DS \texttt{FedProxGrad}} (Decay Step Size \texttt{FedProxGrad}). Under a Robbins-Monro step-size schedule \cite{robbins1951stochastic} and a mild decay condition on local inexactness, we prove that $\liminf_{r\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}^r)\|^2] = 0$, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically stationary and the convergence rate does not depend on a variance-induced noise floor.

Abstract: Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.

Abstract: Scaling inference-time computation has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve strong reasoning performance, but inherently sequential decoding leads to substantial latency, especially on complex tasks. Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent studies on Neural Collapse (NC) reveal that, under class-balanced conditions, the class feature means and classifier weights spontaneously align into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). In long-tailed regimes, however, severe sample imbalance tends to prevent the emergence of the NC phenomenon, resulting in poor generalization performance. Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets consistently boost examined baselines and achieve the state-of-the-art performances.

Abstract: Benchmarking has been the cornerstone of progress in computer vision, natural language processing, and the broader deep learning domain, driving algorithmic innovation through standardized datasets and reproducible evaluation protocols. The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations. We assess eleven architectures spanning neural operator methods (e.g., Fourier Neural Operator), geometric deep learning (PointNet, RegDGCNN, PointMAE, PointTransformer), transformer-based neural solvers (Transolver, Transolver++, AB-UPT), and implicit field networks (TripNet). Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty. To accelerate progress in data-driven engineering, we open-source the benchmark framework, including training pipelines, uncertainty estimation routines based on bootstrap resampling, and pretrained model weights, establishing the first reproducible foundation for large-scale learning from high-fidelity CFD simulations, available at https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/CarBench.

Abstract: New York City reports over one hundred thousand motor vehicle collisions each year, creating substantial injury and public health burden. We present RaX-Crash, a resource efficient and explainable small model pipeline for structured injury severity prediction on the official NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset. RaX-Crash integrates three linked tables with tens of millions of records, builds a unified feature schema in partitioned storage, and trains compact tree based ensembles (Random Forest and XGBoost) on engineered tabular features, which are compared against locally deployed small language models (SLMs) prompted with textual summaries. On a temporally held out test set, XGBoost and Random Forest achieve accuracies of 0.7828 and 0.7794, clearly outperforming SLMs (0.594 and 0.496); class imbalance analysis shows that simple class weighting improves fatal recall with modest accuracy trade offs, and SHAP attribution highlights human vulnerability factors, timing, and location as dominant drivers of predicted severity. Overall, RaX-Crash indicates that interpretable small model ensembles remain strong baselines for city scale injury analytics, while hybrid pipelines that pair tabular predictors with SLM generated narratives improve communication without sacrificing scalability.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in LLM agents, performance on long-horizon, tool-using tasks remains fragile. To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $τ$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\ non-mutating steps and formalize \emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\%$ on Airline and upto $96\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\% \emph{relative} on Airline, +11\% on Retail, and +7\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\%/+7\%. We further identify ceiling effects in $τ$-Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance. To address this, we release $τ$-Bench Verified, which restores benchmark headroom through targeted revisions. Our results argue for action-level analysis, targeted safeguards, and reliable evaluations as prerequisites for robust multi-turn agents.

Abstract: As deep learning models in agentic AI systems grow in scale and complexity, GPU memory requirements increase and often exceed the available GPU memory capacity, so that out-of-memory (OoM) errors occur. It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting task is significant to modern urban management. Recently, there is growing attention on large-scale forecasting, as it better reflects the complexity of real-world traffic networks. However, existing models often exhibit quadratic computational complexity, making them impractical for large-scale real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mixer (HSTMixer), which leverages an all-MLP architecture for efficient and effective large-scale traffic forecasting. HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Abstract: Attention-based Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and shown strong performance in computer vision (CV) tasks. However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement. Experimental results show that LAPA achieves 3.52x, 3.24x and 2.79x higher energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works Spatten, Sanger and FACT, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate disease detection is of paramount importance for effective medical treatment and patient care. However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\% improvement in recall and 7.63\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction. By reducing diagnostic costs and improving accessibility, CLDD holds promise for large-scale disease screening and social health security.

Abstract: We present Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) which have made significant progress in various tasks, but their robustness against domain noise, structural perturbations, and adversarial attacks remains underexplored. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of hierarchical structural semantics, which are crucial for generalization. In this paper, we propose SA^2GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA^2GFM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and robustness against random noise and adversarial perturbations for node and graph classification.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is crucial in numerous real-world applications, such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and posture recognition. TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components. Furthermore, we design an Interactive Mamba Block (IMB) to facilitate efficient multi-granularity information interaction, balancing the extraction of fine-grained discriminative features and comprehensive global contextual information, thereby endowing FAIM with powerful and expressive representations for TSC tasks. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised pre-training mechanism to enhance FAIM's understanding of complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness across various domains and high-noise scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that FAIM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and efficiency and exhibits outstanding performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Semi-supervised anomaly detection (AD) has shown great promise by effectively leveraging limited labeled data. However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, we show that our model's performance consistently improves with increasing set size, providing strong empirical support for the set-based formulation of anomaly detection.

Abstract: New methods are needed to monitor environmental treaties, like the Montreal Protocol, by reviewing large, complex customs datasets. This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare "mega-trades" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in "mega-trades" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act. This work presents a repeatable unsupervised learning pipeline to turn raw trade data into prioritized, usable intelligence for regulatory groups.

TL;DR: 将大规模瑞典登记数据文本化为生活轨迹，用以预测后期居住移动，比较多种NLP模型，证明文本化序列对纵向社会分析有用并可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类变量高基数和时间编码不一致等挑战；利用完整的群体登记数据作为长期、可扩展的分析基底，提供测试新序列模型的严格基准。

Method: 将6.9百万个体(2001-2013)的登记数据转化为语义丰富的文本序列，包含年度居住/工作/教育/收入/家庭等变化；比较多种序列与Transformer模型（包括LSTM、DistilBERT、BERT、Qwen）对预测任务的表现，并评估文本化数据的保真性及模型学习能力。

Result: 文本化的数据保留了关于个体路径的有意义信息；序列和Transformer模型能更好地捕捉时间结构与语义关系，优于基线模型；该数据集在跨国比较有限的条件下提供了一个严谨的测试床，便于分析与评估新型序列建模方法。

Conclusion: 将语义丰富的登记数据与现代语言模型结合，能显著提升社会科学中的纵向分析能力，推动新方法的开发与比较，并为缺乏高质量纵向微观数据的研究领域提供重要的研究范式。

Abstract: We transform large-scale Swedish register data into textual life trajectories to address two long-standing challenges in data analysis: high cardinality of categorical variables and inconsistencies in coding schemes over time. Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences.

Abstract: The sophistication of modern malware, specifically regarding communication with Command and Control (C2) servers, has rendered static blacklist-based defenses obsolete. The use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) allows attackers to generate thousands of dynamic addresses daily, hindering blocking by traditional firewalls. This paper aims to propose and evaluate a method for detecting DGA domains using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The methodology consisted of collecting a hybrid database containing 50,000 legitimate and 50,000 malicious domains, followed by the extraction of lexical features and the training of a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Results demonstrated that while statistical entropy analysis is effective for simple DGAs, the Neural Network approach presents superiority in detecting complex patterns, reaching 97.2% accuracy and reducing the false positive rate in ambiguous lawful traffic scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的医疗时间序列填充框架，结合可自适应感受野的MoE（RFAMoE）与融合MoE（Fusion MoE），实现单步推理的高效噪声重建并提升性能。

Conclusion: 所提框架在提升重建性能的同时显著降低推理延迟与计算成本，具有较强的应用潜力和较好的一般化能力，适合医用时间序列的填充任务。

Abstract: Recent studies show that using diffusion models for time series signal reconstruc- tion holds great promise. However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AV) requires rigorous testing under both everyday driving and rare, safety-critical conditions. A key challenge lies in simulating environment agents, including background vehicles (BVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs), that behave realistically in nominal traffic while also exhibiting risk-prone behaviors consistent with real-world accidents. We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes. Extensive experiments show that CRAG improves diversity compared to existing baselines, while also enabling controllable generation of risk scenarios for targeted and efficient evaluation of AV robustness.

Abstract: Network-on-Chip (NoC) design requires exploring a high-dimensional configuration space to satisfy stringent throughput requirements and latency constraints.Traditional design space exploration techniques are often slow and struggle to handle complex, non-linear parameter interactions.This work presents a machine learning-driven framework that automates NoC design space exploration using BookSim simulations and reverse neural network models.Specifically, we compare three architectures - a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),a Conditional Diffusion Model, and a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to predict optimal NoC parameters given target performance metrics.Our pipeline generates over 150,000 simulation data points across varied mesh topologies.The Conditional Diffusion Model achieved the highest predictive accuracy, attaining a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.463 on unseen data.Furthermore, the proposed framework reduces design exploration time by several orders of magnitude, making it a practical solution for rapid and scalable NoC co-design.

Abstract: Given augmented views of each input graph, contrastive learning methods (e.g., InfoNCE) optimize pairwise alignment of graph embeddings across views while providing no mechanism to control the global structure of the view specific graph-of-graphs built from these embeddings. We introduce SpecMatch-CL, a novel loss function that aligns the view specific graph-of-graphs by minimizing the difference between their normalized Laplacians. Theoretically, we show that under certain assumptions, the difference between normalized Laplacians provides an upper bound not only for the difference between the ideal Perfect Alignment contrastive loss and the current loss, but also for the Uniformly loss. Empirically, SpecMatch-CL establishes new state of the art on eight TU benchmarks under unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning at low label rates, and yields consistent gains in transfer learning on PPI-306K and ZINC 2M datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used tool for learning parts-based, low-dimensional representations of nonnegative data, with applications in vision, text, and bioinformatics. In clustering applications, orthogonal NMF (ONMF) variants further impose (approximate) orthogonality on the representation matrix so that its rows behave like soft cluster indicators. Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or "topics". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\mathbf{X}^\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity. These results demonstrate that explicitly recovering the data cone can yield both theoretically grounded and empirically strong NMF-based clustering methods.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful method in deep learning, excelling at learning effective representations through contrasting samples from different distributions. However, dimensional collapse, where embeddings converge into a lower-dimensional space, poses a significant challenge, especially in semi-supervised and self-supervised setups. In this paper, we first identify a critical learning-rate threshold, beyond which standard contrastive losses converge to collapsed solutions. Building on these insights, we propose CLOP, a novel semi-supervised loss function designed to prevent dimensional collapse by promoting the formation of orthogonal linear subspaces among class embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CLOP improves performance in image classification and object detection tasks while also exhibiting greater stability across different learning rates and batch sizes.

Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclones (TCs) tracking represents a critical challenge in the context of weather and climate science. Traditional tracking schemes mainly rely on subjective thresholds, which may introduce biases in their skills on the geographical region of application. We present ByteStorm, an efficient data-driven framework for reconstructing TC tracks without threshold tuning. It leverages deep learning networks to detect TC centers (via classification and localization), using only relative vorticity (850 mb) and mean sea-level pressure. Then, detected centers are linked into TC tracks through the BYTE algorithm. ByteStorm is evaluated against state-of-the-art deterministic trackers in the East- and West-North Pacific basins (ENP and WNP). The proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of Probability of Detection ($85.05\%$ ENP, $79.48\%$ WNP), False Alarm Rate ($23.26\%$ ENP, $16.14\%$ WNP), and high Inter-Annual Variability correlations ($0.75$ ENP and $0.69$ WNP). These results highlight the potential of integrating deep learning and computer vision for fast and accurate TC tracking, offering a robust alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.

Abstract: Continual learning constrains models to learn new tasks over time without forgetting what they have already learned. A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance. We demonstrate that CIPNet achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to previous exemplar-free and self-explainable methods in both task- and class-incremental settings, while bearing significantly lower memory-related overhead. This makes it a practical and interpretable solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their learned representations and decision-making processes remain largely opaque and hard to interpret. This work introduces HOLE (Homological Observation of Latent Embeddings), a method for analyzing and interpreting deep neural networks through persistent homology. HOLE extracts topological features from neural activations and presents them using a suite of visualization techniques, including Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, dendrograms, and blob graphs. These tools facilitate the examination of representation structure and quality across layers. We evaluate HOLE on standard datasets using a range of discriminative models, focusing on representation quality, interpretability across layers, and robustness to input perturbations and model compression. The results indicate that topological analysis reveals patterns associated with class separation, feature disentanglement, and model robustness, providing a complementary perspective for understanding and improving deep learning systems.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has applications across domains and industries, especially in healthcare, but the technical expertise required to analyze data, build models, and interpret results can be a barrier to using these techniques. This article presents a web platform that makes the process of analyzing and plotting data, training forecasting models, and interpreting and viewing results accessible to researchers and clinicians. Users can upload data and generate plots to showcase their variables and the relationships between them. The platform supports multiple forecasting models and training techniques which are highly customizable according to the user's needs. Additionally, recommendations and explanations can be generated from a large language model that can help the user choose appropriate parameters for their data and understand the results for each model. The goal is to integrate this platform into learning health systems for continuous data collection and inference from clinical pipelines.

Abstract: In critical care settings such as the Intensive Care Unit, clinicians face the complex challenge of balancing conflicting objectives, primarily maximizing patient survival while minimizing resource utilization (e.g., length of stay). Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.
  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in oncology requires predicting dynamic disease evolution, a task current static AI predictors cannot perform. While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning. On the MU-Glioma-Post dataset, our approach outperforms recent MeWM by 12\%, and significantly surpasses all other medical-specific large language models.

Abstract: We propose an interpretable deep competing risks model called the Deep Kernel Aalen-Johansen (DKAJ) estimator, which generalizes the classical Aalen-Johansen nonparametric estimate of cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). Each data point (e.g., patient) is represented as a weighted combination of clusters. If a data point has nonzero weight only for one cluster, then its predicted CIFs correspond to those of the classical Aalen-Johansen estimator restricted to data points from that cluster. These weights come from an automatically learned kernel function that measures how similar any two data points are. On four standard competing risks datasets, we show that DKAJ is competitive with state-of-the-art baselines while being able to provide visualizations to assist model interpretation.

Abstract: Crisis classification in social media aims to extract actionable disaster-related information from multimodal posts, which is a crucial task for enhancing situational awareness and facilitating timely emergency responses. However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be dishonest when reporting on their actions and beliefs -- for example, they may overstate their confidence in factual claims or cover up evidence of covert actions. Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.
  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the "path of least resistance" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.
  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its "main" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user.

Abstract: In this paper, we study whether model-based reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based value expansion, can provide a scalable recipe for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in offline RL. Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an "action chunk") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}. Through experiments on highly challenging tasks with large-scale datasets of up to 100M transitions, we show that MAC achieves the best performance among offline model-based RL algorithms, especially on challenging long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.

Abstract: Most post-training backdoor detection methods rely on attacked models exhibiting extreme outlier detection statistics for the target class of an attack, compared to non-target classes. However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons. An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in various applications underscores the need for agents that can successfully navigate and adapt to an ever-changing, open-ended world. A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions.

Abstract: Language identification is a crucial first step in multilingual systems such as chatbots and virtual assistants, enabling linguistically and culturally accurate user experiences. Errors at this stage can cascade into downstream failures, setting a high bar for accuracy. Yet, existing language identification tools struggle with key cases--such as music requests where the song title and user language differ. Open-source tools like LangDetect, FastText are fast but less accurate, while large language models, though effective, are often too costly for low-latency or low-resource settings. We introduce PolyLingua, a lightweight Transformer-based model for in-domain language detection and fine-grained language classification. It employs a two-level contrastive learning framework combining instance-level separation and class-level alignment with adaptive margins, yielding compact and well-separated embeddings even for closely related languages. Evaluated on two challenging datasets--Amazon Massive (multilingual digital assistant utterances) and a Song dataset (music requests with frequent code-switching)--PolyLingua achieves 99.25% F1 and 98.15% F1, respectively, surpassing Sonnet 3.5 while using 10x fewer parameters, making it ideal for compute- and latency-constrained environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for aligning generative models with human preferences, but its prohibitive computational cost remains a major barrier to widespread adoption. We introduce \textbf{TreeGRPO}, a novel RL framework that dramatically improves training efficiency by recasting the denoising process as a search tree. From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \textbf{2.4$\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space. Our method consistently outperforms GRPO baselines across multiple benchmarks and reward models, providing a scalable and effective pathway for RL-based visual generative model alignment.

Abstract: In our prior work, LayerPipe, we had introduced an approach to accelerate training of convolutional, fully connected, and spiking neural networks by overlapping forward and backward computation. However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs.

Abstract: Mobile phones are the most ubiquitous end devices, generating vast amounts of human-authored data and serving as the primary platform for end-side applications. As high-quality public data for large language models (LLMs) approaches exhaustion, on-device fine-tuning provides an opportunity to leverage private user data while preserving privacy. However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations and establish MobileFineTuner as a viable foundation for future research on on-device LLM training.

Abstract: Decoupled weight decay, solely responsible for the performance advantage of AdamW over Adam, has long been set to proportional to learning rate $γ$ without questioning. Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\propto γ^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\propto γ^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\propto γ^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.

Abstract: Capsule Networks (CapsNets) show exceptional graph representation capacity via dynamic routing and vectorized hierarchical representations, but they model the complex geometries of real\-world graphs poorly by fixed\-curvature space due to the inherent geodesical disconnectedness issues, leading to suboptimal performance. Recent works find that non\-Euclidean pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding graph data, but how to leverage them to improve CapsNets is still underexplored. Here, we extend the Euclidean capsule routing into geodesically disconnected pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds and derive a Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Network (PR\-CapsNet), which models data in pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of adaptive curvature, for graph representation learning. Specifically, PR\-CapsNet enhances the CapsNet with Adaptive Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing by utilizing pseudo\-Riemannian geometry. Unlike single\-curvature or subspace\-partitioning methods, PR\-CapsNet concurrently models hierarchical and cluster or cyclic graph structures via its versatile pseudo\-Riemannian metric. It first deploys Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing to decompose capsule states into spherical\-temporal and Euclidean\-spatial subspaces with diffeomorphic transformations. Then, an Adaptive Curvature Routing is developed to adaptively fuse features from different curvature spaces for complex graphs via a learnable curvature tensor with geometric attention from local manifold properties. Finally, a geometric properties\-preserved Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Classifier is developed to project capsule embeddings to tangent spaces and use curvature\-weighted softmax for classification. Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks show PR\-CapsNet outperforms SOTA models, validating PR\-CapsNet's strong representation power for complex graph structures.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematically rigorous framework for brain-inspired representation learning founded on the interplay between persistent topological structures and cohomological flows. Neural computation is reformulated as the evolution of cochain maps over dynamic simplicial complexes, enabling representations that capture invariants across temporal, spatial, and functional brain states. The proposed architecture integrates algebraic topology with differential geometry to construct cohomological operators that generalize gradient-based learning within a homological landscape. Synthetic data with controlled topological signatures and real neural datasets are jointly analyzed using persistent homology, sheaf cohomology, and spectral Laplacians to quantify stability, continuity, and structural preservation. Empirical results demonstrate that the model achieves superior manifold consistency and noise resilience compared to graph neural and manifold-based deep architectures, establishing a coherent mathematical foundation for topology-driven representation learning.

Abstract: Classical Time Series Classification algorithms are dominated by feature engineering strategies. One of the most prominent of these transforms is ROCKET, which achieves strong performance through random kernel features. We introduce SPROCKET (Selected Prototype Random Convolutional Kernel Transform), which implements a new feature engineering strategy based on prototypes. On a majority of the UCR and UEA Time Series Classification archives, SPROCKET achieves performance comparable to existing convolutional algorithms and the new MR-HY-SP ( MultiROCKET-HYDRA-SPROCKET) ensemble's average accuracy ranking exceeds HYDRA-MR, the previous best convolutional ensemble's performance. These experimental results demonstrate that prototype-based feature transformation can enhance both accuracy and robustness in time series classification.

Abstract: This work proposes a wavelet-based physics-informed quantum neural network framework to efficiently address multiscale partial differential equations that involve sharp gradients, stiffness, rapid local variations, and highly oscillatory behavior. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in evolving environments, particularly regarding data heterogeneity and the rigidity of fixed network topologies. To address these issues, this paper proposes \textbf{SOFA-FL} (Self-Organizing Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Clustered Data Sharing), a novel framework that enables hierarchical federated systems to self-organize and adapt over time.
  The framework is built upon three core mechanisms: (1) \textbf{Dynamic Multi-branch Agglomerative Clustering (DMAC)}, which constructs an initial efficient hierarchical structure; (2) \textbf{Self-organizing Hierarchical Adaptive Propagation and Evolution (SHAPE)}, which allows the system to dynamically restructure its topology through atomic operations -- grafting, pruning, consolidation, and purification -- to adapt to changes in data distribution; and (3) \textbf{Adaptive Clustered Data Sharing}, which mitigates data heterogeneity by enabling controlled partial data exchange between clients and cluster nodes.
  By integrating these mechanisms, SOFA-FL effectively captures dynamic relationships among clients and enhances personalization capabilities without relying on predetermined cluster structures.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a rich source of structured, heterogeneous data, powering a wide range of applications. A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.

Abstract: Axis-aligned decision trees are fast and stable but struggle on datasets with rotated or interaction-dependent decision boundaries, where informative splits require linear combinations of features rather than single-feature thresholds. Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning framework that enables multiple clients (coordinated by a server) to collaboratively train a global model by aggregating the locally trained models without sharing any client's training data. It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) seeks to remove the influence of specified data from a trained model in response to privacy requests or data poisoning. While certified unlearning has been analyzed in centralized and server-orchestrated federated settings (via guarantees analogous to differential privacy, DP), the decentralized setting -- where peers communicate without a coordinator remains underexplored. We study certified unlearning in decentralized networks with fixed topologies and propose RR-DU, a random-walk procedure that performs one projected gradient ascent step on the forget set at the unlearning client and a geometrically distributed number of projected descent steps on the retained data elsewhere, combined with subsampled Gaussian noise and projection onto a trust region around the original model. We provide (i) convergence guarantees in the convex case and stationarity guarantees in the nonconvex case, (ii) $(\varepsilon,δ)$ network-unlearning certificates on client views via subsampled Gaussian $Rényi$ DP (RDP) with segment-level subsampling, and (iii) deletion-capacity bounds that scale with the forget-to-local data ratio and quantify the effect of decentralization (network mixing and randomized subsampling) on the privacy--utility trade-off. Empirically, on image benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10), RR-DU matches a given $(\varepsilon,δ)$ while achieving higher test accuracy than decentralized DP baselines and reducing forget accuracy to random guessing ($\approx 10\%$).

Abstract: The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper discusses the pilot implementation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. It is the third in a series of three papers describing an overall Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework, with previous papers detailing the development of the B3 dataset. The pilot involved running the benchmarks through a sample frontier AI model, followed by human evaluation of model responses, and an applied risk analysis of the results along several dimensions. Overall, the pilot demonstrated that the B3 dataset offers a viable, nuanced method for rapidly assessing the biosecurity risk posed by a LLM, identifying the key sources of that risk and providing guidance for priority areas of mitigation priority.

Abstract: Decoding brain states from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is vital for advancing neuroscience and clinical applications. While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have made strides in leveraging the high-dimensional and complex nature of fMRI data, they often fail to utilize the contextual richness provided by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata. This paper presents a novel framework integrating transformer-based architectures with multimodal inputs, including fMRI data and DICOM metadata. By employing attention mechanisms, the proposed method captures intricate spatial-temporal patterns and contextual relationships, enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. The potential of this framework spans applications in clinical diagnostics, cognitive neuroscience, and personalized medicine. Limitations, such as metadata variability and computational demands, are addressed, and future directions for optimizing scalability and generalizability are discussed.

Abstract: The relationship between Layer Normalization (LN) placement and the over-smoothing phenomenon remains underexplored. We identify a critical dilemma: Pre-LN architectures avoid over-smoothing but suffer from the curse of depth, while Post-LN architectures bypass the curse of depth but experience over-smoothing.
  To resolve this, we propose a new method based on Post-LN that induces algebraic smoothing, preventing over-smoothing without the curse of depth. Empirical results across five benchmarks demonstrate that our approach supports deeper networks (up to 256 layers) and improves performance, requiring no additional parameters.
  Key contributions:
  Theoretical Characterization: Analysis of LN dynamics and their impact on over-smoothing and the curse of depth.
  A Principled Solution: A parameter-efficient method that induces algebraic smoothing and avoids over-smoothing and the curse of depth.
  Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the method in deeper GNNs.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.

Abstract: Stock market prediction is a long-standing challenge in finance, as accurate forecasts support informed investment decisions. Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions.

Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of professional basketball games, particularly in the National Basketball Association (NBA), has become increasingly important for coaching strategy, fan engagement, and sports betting. However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems.

Abstract: Part qualification is crucial in additive manufacturing (AM) because it ensures that additively manufactured parts can be consistently produced and reliably used in critical applications. Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality, yet they have been repeatedly shown to exhibit social biases across sensitive attributes such as gender, race and age. To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart. Our findings uncover TTI vulnerabilities, while BGPS expands the bias search space and can act as a new evaluation tool for bias mitigation.

Abstract: The advancement of human healthspan and bioengineering relies heavily on predicting the behavior of complex biological systems. While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets. Furthermore, the NODE models demonstrated a 1000x acceleration in inference time, establishing them as a scalable, high-fidelity tool for the next generation of metabolic engineering and biological discovery.

Abstract: Early graph prompt tuning approaches relied on task-specific designs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting their adaptability across diverse pre-training strategies. In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large data have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities across domains. Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models.

Abstract: Uplift modeling estimates the causal effect of an intervention as the difference between potential outcomes under treatment and control, whereas counterfactual identification aims to recover the joint distribution of these potential outcomes (e.g., "Would this customer still have churned had we given them a marketing offer?"). This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone.

Abstract: With the increasing reliance on AI models for weather forecasting, it is imperative to evaluate their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems.

Abstract: TD($λ$) with function approximation has proved empirically successful for some complex reinforcement learning problems. For linear approximation, TD($λ$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value. However, as far as policy is concerned, it is error in the relative ordering of states that is critical, rather than error in the state values. We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($λ$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($λ$), called STD($λ$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($λ$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1]. This is followed by successful demonstrations of STD($λ$) on the two-state system and a variation on the well known acrobot problem.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-IMU (inertial measurement unit) motion-synthesis framework to obtain realistic IMU data by fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model with an acceleration-based second-order loss (L_acc). L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model. We conclude that acceleration-aware diffusion refinement provides an effective approach to align motion generation and IMU synthesis and highlights how flexible deep learning pipelines are for specialising generic text-to-motion priors to sensor-specific tasks.

Abstract: The widespread use of big data across sectors has raised major privacy concerns, especially when sensitive information is shared or analyzed. Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees.

Abstract: LLM agents are widely deployed in complex interactive tasks, yet privacy constraints often preclude centralized optimization and co-evolution across dynamic environments. While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-quality tabular synthetic data. In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data.

Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit temporal dynamics characterized by evolving data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression.

Abstract: While scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally focus on proxy metrics like pretraining loss, predicting downstream task performance has been considered unreliable. This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful path toward discovering sustainable polymer materials, but progress has been limited by the lack of large, high-quality, and openly accessible polymer datasets. The Open Polymer Challenge (OPC) addresses this gap by releasing the first community-developed benchmark for polymer informatics, featuring a dataset with 10K polymers and 5 properties: thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, density, fractional free volume, and glass transition temperature. The challenge centers on multi-task polymer property prediction, a core step in virtual screening pipelines for materials discovery. Participants developed models under realistic constraints that include small data, label imbalance, and heterogeneous simulation sources, using techniques such as feature-based augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, and targeted ensemble strategies. The competition also revealed important lessons about data preparation, distribution shifts, and cross-group simulation consistency, informing best practices for future large-scale polymer datasets. The resulting models, analysis, and released data create a new foundation for molecular AI in polymer science and are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable and energy-efficient materials. Along with the competition, we release the test dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexliu99/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025-test-data. We also release the data generation pipeline at https://github.com/sobinalosious/ADEPT, which simulates more than 25 properties, including thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, and density.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based posterior sampling method within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework. Our approach constructs a probability transport from an easy-to-sample terminal distribution to the target posterior, using a warm-start strategy to initialize the particles. To approximate the posterior score, we develop a Monte Carlo estimator in which particles are generated using Langevin dynamics, avoiding the heuristic approximations commonly used in prior work. The score governing the Langevin dynamics is learned from data, enabling the model to capture rich structural features of the underlying prior distribution. On the theoretical side, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds, showing that the method converges even for complex, multi-modal target posterior distributions. These bounds explicitly quantify the errors arising from posterior score estimation, the warm-start initialization, and the posterior sampling procedure. Our analysis further clarifies how the prior score-matching error and the condition number of the Bayesian inverse problem influence overall performance. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across a range of inverse problems.
