### [1] [Social Determinants of Health Prediction for ICD-9 Code with Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09709)
*Sharim Khan,Paul Landes,Adam Cross,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在MIMIC-III数据集上对住院级多标签SDoH ICD-9编码进行分类，结合推理模型与传统大语言模型，基于现有 ICD-9 编码达到89% F1，并揭示139例就诊中的缺失SDoH编码，附带可复现代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会决定因素（SDoH）与患者结局相关，但往往未在结构化数据中呈现。通过从临床文本自动提取SDoH，可为诊断系统增添对患者社会环境的认知。尽管大语言模型在句子级SDoH标签识别方面表现出色，但在长文本、长距离依赖场景（如长住院记录和纵向笔记）中预测仍具挑战性。

Method: 在MIMIC-III上进行住院级多标签SDoH ICD-9编码分类，比较推理模型与传统大语言模型的性能；利用现有 ICD-9 编码作为预测信号（标签信息），并尝试处理长文本中的长距离依赖以提高对住院和纵向笔记的预测能力。

Result: 对住院级SDoH ICD-9编码预测，现有 ICD-9 编码的F1达到约89%。并报告139例就诊记录中缺失的SDoH编码，以及提供复现实验代码。

Conclusion: 将SDoH信息从临床文本中提取并结合当前的ICD-9编码进行住院级多标签预测具有实际潜力，但数据中的编码缺失需要关注。研究提供可复现代码以促进后续工作。

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{in-context operator learning on probability measure spaces} for optimal transport (OT). The goal is to learn a single solution operator that maps a pair of distributions to the OT map, using only few-shot samples from each distribution as a prompt and \emph{without} gradient updates at inference. We parameterize the solution operator and develop scaling-law theory in two regimes. In the \emph{nonparametric} setting, when tasks concentrate on a low-intrinsic-dimension manifold of source--target pairs, we establish generalization bounds that quantify how in-context accuracy scales with prompt size, intrinsic task dimension, and model capacity. In the \emph{parametric} setting (e.g., Gaussian families), we give an explicit architecture that recovers the exact OT map in context and provide finite-sample excess-risk bounds. Our numerical experiments on synthetic transports and generative-modeling benchmarks validate the framework.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

Abstract: As black box models and pretrained models gain traction in time series applications, understanding and explaining their predictions becomes increasingly vital, especially in high-stakes domains where interpretability and trust are essential. However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations. Our code is available in an easy-to-use library TimeSAE-Lib: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/TimeSAE-571D/.

### [5] [Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Step Lookahead Information Via Adaptive Batching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10418)
*Nadav Merlis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在多步前瞻信息的表格强化学习中，提出自适应分批策略 ABP，给出最优贝尔曼方程并设计一个乐观回报的学习算法，在未知环境下实现近似最优ABP的学习，理论回报界与最优性接近，至多差一个前瞻步长的常数因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前瞻信息可以显著提升策略的价值，但全局最优策略求解是NP-hard，现有两种可行近似（固定分批和模型预测控制）存在局部性与局部最优的问题，需要一个自适应的、状态依赖的分批方案。

Method: 提出自适应分批策略（ABP），对ABP建立最优贝尔曼方程并给出一个乐观回报最小化学习算法；在未知环境中通过探索-利用框架学习ABP。

Result: 给出等价的贝尔曼方程，设计的算法在对数量级的最坏情况下达到与信息极限相同的回报，且回报界是观测到的前瞻步长的常数因子之下的近似最优。

Conclusion: 自适应分批策略弥补固定分批的刚性，提供理论上接近最优的回报界，并在未知环境中可学习 ABP，理论与实验均支持其优越性。

Abstract: We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.

### [6] [QFed: Parameter-Compact Quantum-Classical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09809)
*Samar Abdelghani,Soumaya Cherkaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum-assisted federated learning (QFed) reduces model parameter count and training overhead using quantum techniques, achieving 77.6% parameter reduction on a VGG-like model for FashionMNIST while maintaining accuracy, suggesting potential gains for edge FL systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaboration but faces statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and high computational costs. Incorporating quantum computing could compress models and reduce training overhead, potentially enabling more efficient edge deployment.

Method: Propose and implement QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework designed to boost computational efficiency across edge device networks. Evaluate on FashionMNIST with a VGG-like model to assess parameter reduction and accuracy trade-offs in a scalable environment.

Result: QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like network while maintaining accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable setup.

Conclusion: Integrating quantum computing with federated learning shows promise for reducing model complexity and training overhead on edge devices without sacrificing accuracy, signaling a new direction for FL efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Organizations and enterprises across domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research are increasingly required to extract collective intelligence from distributed, siloed datasets while adhering to strict privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.

### [7] [On the origin of neural scaling laws: from random graphs to natural language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10684)
*Maissam Barkeshli,Alberto Alfarano,Andrey Gromov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在简化任务下研究神经缩放定律：变压器在预测随机游走和简化语言序列时仍能呈现缩放规律，即使数据不含幂律结构；并分析不同复杂度、不同图结构上的缩放行为，以及对传统语言模型缩放的复现实验，提出计算最优曲线的新方法与对最大更新参数化的初步证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经缩放定律的来源，检验是否需要数据中存在幂律结构，以及在受控、简化的任务中对缩放规律的普遍性与边界条件进行系统评估。

Method: 1) 让变压器在随机游走（bigrams）任务上预测，图结构的复杂度可调；2) 通过逐步降低语言模型复杂度（4层、2层、1层，再到语言大词对）并观察缩放指数的演化；3) 在随机图（Erdős–Rényi 与 Barabási–Albert）上的随机游走任务中研究缩放；4) 重新检验语言模型的传统缩放规律，使用2层变压器、上下文长度50复现关键结果，比较拟合方法，提出计算最优曲线的新做法，并给出最大更新参数化（MUP）潜在的参数效率证据。

Result: 论文展示了在简化任务下也能得到缩放定律，即使缺乏数据中的幂律结构；缩放指数随着模型复杂度降低呈单调演化；ER 与 BA 图上的随机游走也呈现缩放规律；通过2层、较短上下文的设置可复现传统语言模型缩放的若干关键现象；对拟合和计算最优曲线的分析提出新方法，并给出MUP可能更具参数效率的初步证据。

Conclusion: 缩放定律具有一定鲁棒性，存在于简化任务和多样化的图结构中，可能不仅来自数据的幂律性质，也与模型结构与训练设定相关。这为理解缩放规律的起源、优化参数化以及资源分配提供新视角。

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.

### [8] [Eluder dimension: localise it!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09825)
*Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Samuel Robertson,David Janz,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 给出广义线性模型类的 eluder 维数下界，揭示传统基于 eluder 维的分析无法获得一阶遗憾界限；引入 eluder 维的局部化方法，能够直接推导并改进伯努利赌博机结果，并首次给出有限-horizon 强化学习任务中对累积回报的真正一阶界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于 eluder 维的分析在广义线性模型（GLM）下难以获得一阶遗憾界限，亟需新的分析工具来实现更强的 regret 上界，尤其在有限时间和有界累积回报情形下。

Method: 给出 eluder 维的下界，证明标准的 eluder 维分析无法带来一阶遗憾界限；提出 eluder 维的局部化(localisation)方法；利用局部化分析回收并改进伯努利赌博机的经典结果，并推导出有限-horizon RL 的第一阶界限。

Result: 在 GLM 类上给出 eluder 维的下界，显示传统 eluder 维分析无法实现一阶遗憾界限；引入局部化的 eluder 维分析框架，能直接回收并提升伯努利赌博机结果；首次给出有限-horizon 强化学习任务中对累积回报的真正一阶界限。

Conclusion: 局部化 eluder 维的方法克服了传统分析的限制，实现对更广泛模型的第一阶遗憾界限，提升了在伯努利 bandits 与有限-horizon RL 等情境中的理论保障与应用潜力。

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the eluder dimension of generalised linear model classes, showing that standard eluder dimension-based analysis cannot lead to first-order regret bounds. To address this, we introduce a localisation method for the eluder dimension; our analysis immediately recovers and improves on classic results for Bernoulli bandits, and allows for the first genuine first-order bounds for finite-horizon reinforcement learning tasks with bounded cumulative returns.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a new convergence theory for plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) under prior mismatch where the denoiser is trained on a different data distribution to the inference task at hand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence proof of PnP-PGD under prior mismatch. Compared with the existing theoretical results for PnP algorithms, our new results removed the need for several restrictive and unverifiable assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个面向医疗场景的因果公平性管道，区分直接偏见与间接偏见，并在无偏见 foundation 模型基础上实现因果公平的下游预测，具有模型无关性与普遍适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗场景中的机器学习可能放大现有的健康不平等。路径特定的因果公平性使研究者能够区分直接由医生或模型引起的歧视与由系统性差异导致的偏差，并在观测数据中实现可解释且可控的公平目标。需要将结构性公平性理论映射到现实的观测性健康数据，提出一个通用且与具体医疗情境相适应的训练管道。

Method: 将结构公平模型映射到观测性健康数据上，构建一个明确考虑医疗情境与差异的目标公平模型的训练管道；通过区分直接与间接偏见，综合考虑公平性与准确性之间的权衡；演示如何利用未对公平进行约束的 foundation 模型来产生具因果公平性的下游预测；该管道为模型无关、可泛化应用的解决方案。

Result: 提出一种通用、模型无关的训练管道，用于学习因果公平的医疗 ML 模型，能够区分直接与间接偏见，兼顾公平性与准确性，并能借助基础模型实现因果公平的下游预测。

Conclusion: 该工作填补两大缺口：一是深化对 fairness-accuracy 权衡的理解，尤其在直接与间接偏见的分离与联合考虑层面；二是展示如何利用未经 fairness 约束的 foundation 模型来生成具因果公平性的下游预测，提供一个面向广泛医疗情境的模型无关管道。

Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced natural language processing but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

### [12] [Interpolation-Based Optimization for Enforcing lp-Norm Metric Differential Privacy in Continuous and Fine-Grained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09946)
*Chenxi Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于插值的框架来在细粒度/连续域中优化 lp-norm 的 mDP。通过在稀疏锚点点上优化扰动分布并在非锚点处采用对数凸组合进行插值，理论上保持 mDP；将高维插值分解为一系列一维步骤以避免隐私违规，并对扰动分布和跨维度的隐私预算进行联合优化。实验证明在真实定位数据集上具有严格的隐私保障与竞争力的效用，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度或连续数据域中，直接优化 mDP 需要构造密集的扰动矩阵并满足逐点约束，计算成本高且难以扩展。现有的优化方法在粗粒度域有效，但在高维/连续域的可用性受限，因此需要高效且可扩展的解决方案来实现更好的隐私和效用平衡。

Method: 提出一个插值框架：在稀疏的锚点处优化扰动分布，并通过对数凸组合在非锚点处插值，确保插值过程不违反 mDP；为避免高维空间中插值导致的隐私违规，将插值分解成一系列一维步骤并给出修正式使 lp-norm mDP 成为设计约束；并探索对扰动分布与跨维度隐私预算的联合优化。

Result: 在真实定位数据集上，所提方法给出严格的隐私保障并实现具有竞争力的效用，显著优于基线机制，且具备更好的可扩展性与计算效率。

Conclusion: 该插值框架为在细粒度与连续域中优化 mDP 提供了一条可扩展且理论上可行的路径，通过将高维问题分解并进行锚点-插值策略，兼顾隐私保证与实用性，具备扩展到其他数据类型和预算分配策略的潜力。

Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

Motivation: 离散标记在低信噪比下对连续时间信号容易脆弱，尤其在下游目标带有不对称惩罚、促使拒绝执行的设置中。为提升可学习性与对弃权损失的鲁棒性，提出一种显式的连续时间表示来重建信号的平滑轨迹并对局部时间-导数系数进行标注。

Method: 基于优化的连续时间表示，从噪声测量中重建一个显式样条，并对局部样条系数（位置、速度、加速度、跃动）进行标记化。将其应用于金融时间序列（资产价格和成交量轮廓），在多资产日频数据上以风险厌恶的非对称分类目标进行评估。

Result: 在风险厌恶、弃权性损失下，离散基线多从策略上退化为清算平衡（Liquidation Equilibrium），而连续样条标记保持了校准且非平凡的行动分布和稳定策略。

Conclusion: 显式连续时间标记能提升在带有弃权损失的噪声时间序列中的可学习性与策略校准。

Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.

Conclusion: 提出的EDVEX框架为数据交易提供一个阶梯性、可扩展的公平机制起点，文章还指向在数据交易与道德、法理、治理等领域的进一步研究方向与观点。

Abstract: We argue that the machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to an economic data processing inequality: each state in the data cycle from inputs to model weights to synthetic outputs refines technical signal but strips economic equity from data generators. We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants. Finally, we outline research directions where our community can make concrete contributions to data deals and contextualize our position with related and orthogonal viewpoints.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a core machine learning problem with broad applications. Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaTRQ 提出一种面向大容量存储的近似最近邻精炼系统，通过分层内存与残差分量实现不需要从存储层读取全向量的精炼，采用分级残差量化与自适应提前停止，配合在 CXL Type-2 上的定制加速器，提升存储效率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本与多模态嵌入的 ANNS 系统在二次精炼阶段仍需从 SSD 读取全精度向量，成为查询延迟主导因素。需要在大规模远存储情境下减少数据移动和 I/O 成本，以降低延迟。

Method: 提出 FaTRQ：基于分层内存的远存系统，通过渐进距离估计器使用从远内存流出的紧凑残差来细化分数。采用分层残差量化，将残差编码为三值型（ternary）并高效存储在远存中。若候选结果已可证明不在前 k 名，则提前停止精炼。并在 CXL Type-2 设备上部署定制加速器以本地实现低延迟精炼。

Result: 与 SOTA GPU ANNS 系统相比，存储效率提升约 2.4 倍，吞吐量提升高达约 9 倍。

Conclusion: FaTRQ 通过分层远存、紧凑残差量化及本地加速实现对全向量读取的替代，从而显著降低 ANNS 的数据移动成本与延迟，提升对大规模嵌入的检索性能。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_θ(H, τ, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.

### [18] [PID-Guided Partial Alignment for Multimodal Decentralized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10012)
*Yanhang Shi,Xiaoyu Wang,Houwei Cao,Jian Li,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARSE: a server-free, multimodal decentralized FL framework that uses partial information decomposition to split each agent’s latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices; enables slice-level, modality-aware sharing over P2P networks, resolving gradient conflicts between uni- and multimodal agents and improving performance across heterogeneous agent mixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal federated learning, heterogeneity in modalities and model architectures causes gradient misalignment when forcing all agents to share a single monolithic embedding, especially in decentralized P2P settings without a central coordinator.

Method: Each agent performs feature fission to decompose its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices via a partial information decomposition-inspired mechanism. Agents exchange only the slices that are semantically shareable given their modalities, enabling slice-level alignment across heterogeneous peers. The framework is server-free and avoids gradient surgery.

Result: PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines across multiple benchmarks and agent mixes. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, plus qualitative visualizations, demonstrate robustness and efficiency of the approach.

Conclusion: PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints in a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer setting.

Abstract: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables collaboratively model training on decentralized, heterogeneous data while tailoring them to each client's unique distribution. However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

### [20] [Time Aggregation Features for XGBoost Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10019)
*Mykola Pinchuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-aware feature aggregation for CTR XGBoost on Avazu with strict out-of-time splits; trailing window aggregation outperforms target encoding, while other window designs underperform or give only marginal gains. Practical default: use trailing window; consider event-count window if marginal ROC AUC gains matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how temporally aware feature engineering can improve click-through rate prediction under no-lookahead constraints, by comparing various time-aggregation schemes to a strong time-aware target encoding baseline on a realistic dataset.

Method: Use Avazu CTR dataset with strict out-of-time splits and no-lookahead; compare baseline time-aware target encoding to models augmented with entity history time aggregation across several window designs (trailing, event-count, gap, bucketized). Two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic 10% sample; evaluate ROC AUC and PR AUC.

Result: Trailing window specification yields ROC AUC gains of about 0.0066–0.0082 and PR AUC gains of about 0.0084–0.0094 over target encoding alone. Within the time-aggregation grid, event-count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, but gains are small. Gap and bucketized windows underperform trailing windows in this setup.

Conclusion: Default recommendation is to use trailing windows for time aggregation; an optional event-count window can be used if extra ROC AUC gains are desired, at the cost of marginal improvement.

Abstract: This paper studies time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction. The setting is the Avazu click-through rate prediction dataset with strict out-of-time splits and a no-lookahead feature constraint. Features for hour H use only impressions from hours strictly before H. This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.

### [21] [BPE: Behavioral Profiling Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10024)
*Yanxin Liu,Yunqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种行为画像的集成框架（BPE），为每个基模型构建行为画像并基于测试样例输出与行为画像的偏差来分配权重，从而克服静态/动态集成方法对模型间差异的过度依赖以及对验证集的强依赖，在预测准确性、计算效率和存储资源方面优于SOTA基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的集成方法在权重分配上把模型视为整体，忽略了模型在不同样本区域的能力差异；现有DES亦以模型间差异为基础，且强依赖验证集来估计能力，缺乏对模型本身特征的利用。因此需要一种以模型自身行为特征为核心的新框架。

Method: 为每个基模型构建一个“行为画像”，记录其对各种输入的反应模式。对待测样本，评估该模型输出相对于其行为画像的偏差，进而得到该模型的集成权重；该权重反映该模型对当前样本的契合程度而非整体性能。通过在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验，与SOTA基线比较，评估准确性、计算效率和存储开销。

Result: 所提出的BPE框架及其派生算法在预测准确性、计算效率和存储资源利用方面显著优于当前的集成基线，且在多种情境下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 行为画像提供了一种以模型内部特征为驱动的动态集成策略，减轻对验证集的依赖，提升跨样本区域的适应性，并提高整体系统资源利用率。

Abstract: Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, yet the quality of their predictions is fundamentally limited by the few costly labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.

Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.

Conclusion: Sparse-RL 在稀疏回合下实现稳定的强化学习训练，并且天然具备稀疏推理的鲁棒性优势，有望缓解大模型 RL 训练的资源瓶颈并提升部署鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

Abstract: The meta-analysis's utility is dependent on previous studies having accurately captured the variables of interest, but in medical studies, a key decision variable that impacts a physician's decisions was not captured. This results in an unknown effect size and unreliable conclusions. A Bayesian approach may allow analysis to determine if the claim of a positive effect is still warranted, and we build a Bayesian approach to this common medical scenario. To demonstrate its utility, we assist professional OBGYNs in evaluating Trial of Labor After a Cesarean-section (TOLAC) situations where few interventions are available for patients and find the support needed for physicians to advance patient care.

Conclusion: 层级级别的模态集成是实现跨临床条件鲁棒性的关键，LeMoF提供了一种在保持预测稳定性与提升判别力之间的平衡的融合框架。

Abstract: Multimodal clinical prediction is widely used to integrate heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biosignals. However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.

Method: METAL 只训练少量线性层，将多语言文本嵌入投影到与英语文本对齐的多模态空间，使用英语文本来完成对齐。结果分析表明该变换会重塑嵌匀的几何形状，而非简单旋转。

Result: 在英语的 Recall@10 为 94.9%，在 11 种语言（10 个未 seen）上对 XTD 文本到图像检索的零-shot 迁移平均 Recall@10 为 89.5%。可视化显示多语言嵌入与多模态表示紧密对齐。还扩展到音频-文本检索和跨语言文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: METAL 证明了一个极简的对齐策略也能实现强大的跨语言跨模态能力，且具备良好泛化性和可扩展性。代码、检查点和多语言数据集已开源，为后续研究提供资源。

Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.
  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.

Motivation: LTV 预测存在零膨胀且长尾分布，绝大多数低/中值用户压制了少数高价值用户（鲸鱼群体），且低/中值用户内仍存在显著异质性。现有方法要么依赖严格的统计假设，要么通过有序桶的损失约束来解耦排序与回归，往往难以在全局准确性与高价值精度之间取得平衡，且往往没有在架构层面自然地保证排序。

Method: 提出一个结构化的有序分解模块、桶内残差回归模块和有针对性的高价值增强模块的三段式架构，形成一个统一的 CC-OR-Net。通过结构性有序分解实现鲁棒的排序；通过桶内残差模块实现对桶内细粒度回归的精细化；通过高价值增强模块聚焦高价值用户的预测精度。

Result: 在真实世界数据集（覆盖超过3亿用户）上评估，CC-OR-Net在关键业务指标上实现更优的权衡，显著优于现有方法，表现出更全面且具商业价值的 LTV 预测能力。

Conclusion: CC-OR-Net通过结构化分解实现对排序的架构性保证，并在回归粒度与高价值精度之间取得平衡，提供一个面向实际商业场景的全面LTV预测解决方案。

Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value "whale" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{C}ascaded \textbf{O}rdinal-\textbf{R}esidual Networks \textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.

Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GR-PCA 将 PCA 扩展为对非各向同性噪声和特征依赖进行建模的图正则化方法。通过学习稀疏精度图并将载荷偏向图拉普拉斯低频模式，GR-PCA 在保持预测性能的同时提高结构保真度与可解释性，尤其在高频信号与图结构相关时效果更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据中变量之间存在依赖关系且噪声并非各向同性，破坏了PCA的各向同性噪声假设。需要引入数据特征的结构信息以获得更具解释性的降维结果。

Method: 在PCA目标上加入图正则化：学习一个稀疏的精度图以描述特征依赖性，并将载荷偏向对应图的低频傅里叶模态（通过图拉普拉斯谱能量约束）。评估在多种合成图结构、信噪比和稀疏度下的表现，并与主流方法对比。

Result: 相较于对比方法，GR-PCA 在期望支集上聚集方差、载荷具有更低的图拉普拉斯能量，且在样本外重建上保持竞争力；当存在高频信号且与图相关时，图拉普拉斯惩罚可抑制过拟合、提高结构保真度，尽管可能略降重建精度。相对PCA，在高频信号与图相关时优势更明显；当高频信号近似旋转不变时，PCA也具备竞争力。该方法实现简单、模块化且可扩展。

Conclusion: 在降维中引入结构信息的GR-PCA 提供一种实用的结构感知降维路线，在不显著损害预测性能的前提下提升结构保真度与可解释性。

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $σ\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $κ\ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4π\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.

Conclusion: 通过显式的特征向量对齐，X-SAM解决了 SAM 在梯度与 Hessian 最大特征向量不对齐时的局限，提供更高效的最大特征值正则化和更好的泛化性能，并为后续在谱信息上的优化研究提供方向。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that does not require run-to-failure labels. First, operating-condition effects in NASA CMAPSS sensor streams are removed via regression-based normalisation; then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder is trained only on the healthy portion of each trajectory. Persistent reconstruction error, estimated using an adaptive data-driven threshold, triggers real-time alerts without hand-tuned rules. Benchmark results show high recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes, demonstrating that the method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.

Conclusion: 通过连续时间 Koopman 正规化的 PINN 能够获得稀疏且稳定的动力学生成矩阵，从而提升模型的泛化与长期预测能力，且矩阵指数积分避免了离散时间 Koopman 的局限性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.

Abstract: The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.

Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.

Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these "what-if" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.

Abstract: Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.

Abstract: We present DeFlow, a decoupled offline RL framework that leverages flow matching to faithfully capture complex behavior manifolds. Optimizing generative policies is computationally prohibitive, typically necessitating backpropagation through ODE solvers. We address this by learning a lightweight refinement module within an explicit, data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, rather than sacrificing the iterative generation capability via single-step distillation. This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity. Empirically, DeFlow achieves superior performance on the challenging OGBench benchmark and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.

Abstract: This note introduces Projected Microbatch Accumulation (PROMA), a proximal policy update method for large language model fine-tuning. PROMA accumulates policy gradients across microbatches by projecting out sequence-wise gradient components before microbatch aggregation. The projection is applied layer-wise during the backward pass, enabling efficient implementation without additional forward or backward passes. Empirically, PROMA enforces tighter control of local KL divergence than GRPO, resulting in more stable policy learning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, PROMA achieves proximal updates without inducing entropy collapse and does not rely on a reference policy or likelihood-ratio clipping.

Abstract: Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, which dynamically adapt to changing spectrum environments, could benefit significantly from advancements in machine learning technologies. These systems can be enhanced in terms of spectral efficiency, robustness, and security through innovative approaches such as the use of Transformer models. This work investigates the application of Transformer models, specifically the GPT-2 architecture, to generate novel modulation schemes for wireless communications. By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods. This demonstrates that advanced CR systems could greatly benefit from the implementation of Transformer models, leading to more efficient, robust, and secure communication systems.

Abstract: The predominance of machine learning models in many spheres of human activity has led to a growing demand for their transparency. The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models. Keywords: PAC-Bayes, risk bounds, local models, transparent models, mixtures of local transparent models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) improve the explainability of black-box Deep Learning (DL) by introducing intermediate semantic concepts. However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.

Abstract: The research undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), highlighting their effectiveness in solving essential computational challenges like nonlinear function approximation, time-series prediction, and multivariate classification. Rooted in Kolmogorov's representation theorem, KANs utilize adaptive spline-based activation functions and grid-based structures, providing a transformative approach compared to traditional neural network frameworks. Utilizing a variety of datasets spanning mathematical function estimation (quadratic and cubic) to practical uses like predicting daily temperatures and categorizing wines, the proposed research thoroughly assesses model performance via accuracy measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and computational expense assessed through Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). The results indicate that KANs reliably exceed MLPs in every benchmark, attaining higher predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs. Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments. By elucidating the architectural and functional distinctions between KANs and MLPs, the paper provides a systematic framework for selecting the most suitable neural architectures for specific tasks. Furthermore, the proposed study highlights the transformative capabilities of KANs in progressing intelligent systems, influencing their use in situations that require both interpretability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization augmented machine learning (COAML) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating predictive models with combinatorial decision-making. By embedding combinatorial optimization oracles into learning pipelines, COAML enables the construction of policies that are both data-driven and feasibility-preserving, bridging the traditions of machine learning, operations research, and stochastic optimization. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in COAML. We introduce a unifying framework for COAML pipelines, describe their methodological building blocks, and formalize their connection to empirical cost minimization. We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure. Using this taxonomy, we review algorithmic approaches for static and dynamic problems, survey applications across domains such as scheduling, vehicle routing, stochastic programming, and reinforcement learning, and synthesize methodological contributions in terms of empirical cost minimization, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Finally, we identify key research frontiers. This survey aims to serve both as a tutorial introduction to the field and as a roadmap for future research at the interface of combinatorial optimization and machine learning.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.

Abstract: Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple parties to jointly train learning models without sharing their own underlying data, offering a practical pathway to privacy-preserving collaboration under data-governance constraints. Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.

Abstract: We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \emph{high-quality} samples.
  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.

Abstract: We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.

Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models are a powerful tool for representing causal relationships among jointly distributed random variables, especially concerning data from across different experimental settings. However, it is not always practical or desirable to estimate a causal model at the granularity of given features in a particular dataset. There is a growing body of research on causal abstraction to address such problems. We contribute to this line of research by (i) providing novel graphical identifiability results for practically-relevant interventional settings, (ii) proposing an efficient, provably consistent algorithm for directly learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data with unknown intervention targets, and (iii) uncovering theoretical insights about the lattice structure of the underlying search space, with connections to the field of causal discovery more generally. As proof of concept, we apply our algorithm on synthetic and real datasets with known ground truths, including measurements from a controlled physical system with interacting light intensity and polarization.

Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($α_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($α_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=α_c-α_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $α_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $α_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($κ=1$ margin) we obtain $α_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $α_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $α_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $α\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $κ\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{α_a}{-\log\left ( α_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.
