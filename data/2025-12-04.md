### [1] [A note on the impossibility of conditional PAC-efficient reasoning in large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03057)
*Hao Zeng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 在分布无关设定下，条件PAC高效不可实现；对于非原子输入空间，几乎所有输入下只能以1−α的概率转向专家模型，等同于“始终使用专家”的简化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合专家框架下点对点推理的理论极限，检验在分布无关条件下能否获得有意义的条件性高效保证。

Method: 给出分布无关场景下的不可行性证明，依赖非原子输入空间性质，证明若存在实现条件PAC高效的算法，则其对几乎所有输入都退回到专家模型的策略才是可行的。

Result: 在非原子输入空间的分布无关设置中，条件PAC高效不可实现，任何算法在几乎所有输入上都必须以高概率调用专家模型。

Conclusion: 结论表明，若坚持分布无关与条件性点对点保证，理论上不可避免地退化为简单的专家调用策略；未来可能需要在受限输入空间、特定分布或放宽为边际/平均情形的前提下寻找可行性。

Abstract: We prove an impossibility result for conditional Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-efficient reasoning in large language models. While recent work has established marginal PAC efficiency guarantees for composite models that switch between expensive expert models and cheaper fast models, we show that conditional (pointwise) guarantees are impossible in the distribution-free setting. Specifically, for non-atomic input spaces, any algorithm achieving conditional PAC efficiency must be trivial in the sense that it defers to the expert model with probability at least $1-α$ for almost every input.

Abstract: We study estimation and statistical inference for reward models used in aligning large language models (LLMs). A key component of LLM alignment is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where humans compare pairs of model-generated answers and their preferences are used to train a reward model. However, human feedback is inherently heterogeneous, creating significant challenges for reliable reward learning. To address this, we adopt a heterogeneous preference framework that jointly models the latent reward of answers and human rationality. This leads to a challenging biconvex optimization problem, which we solve via an alternating gradient descent algorithm. We establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting estimator, including its convergence and asymptotic distribution. These results enable the construction of confidence intervals for reward estimates. Leveraging these uncertainty quantification results, we conduct valid statistical comparisons between rewards and incorporate uncertainty into the best-of-$N$ (BoN) policy framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and applications to real LLM data highlight the practical value of accounting for uncertainty in reward modeling for LLM alignment.

Abstract: We introduce iterative tilting, a gradient-free method for fine-tuning diffusion models toward reward-tilted distributions. The method decomposes a large reward tilt $\exp(λr)$ into $N$ sequential smaller tilts, each admitting a tractable score update via first-order Taylor expansion. This requires only forward evaluations of the reward function and avoids backpropagating through sampling chains. We validate on a two-dimensional Gaussian mixture with linear reward, where the exact tilted distribution is available in closed form.

Abstract: We frame novelty detection on path space as a hypothesis testing problem with signature-based test statistics. Using transportation-cost inequalities of Gasteratos and Jacquier (2023), we obtain tail bounds for false positive rates that extend beyond Gaussian measures to laws of RDE solutions with smooth bounded vector fields, yielding estimates of quantiles and p-values. Exploiting the shuffle product, we derive exact formulae for smooth surrogates of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in terms of expected signatures, leading to new one-class SVM algorithms optimising smooth CVaR objectives. We then establish lower bounds on type-$\mathrm{II}$ error for alternatives with finite first moment, giving general power bounds when the reference measure and the alternative are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. Finally, we evaluate numerically the type-$\mathrm{I}$ error and statistical power of signature-based test statistic, using synthetic anomalous diffusion data and real-world molecular biology data.

Abstract: Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) encode conditional dependencies among random variables using a graph -nodes for variables, links for dependencies- and factorize the joint distribution into lower-dimensional components. This makes PGMs well-suited for analyzing complex systems and supporting decision-making. Recent advances in topological signal processing highlight the importance of variables defined on topological spaces in several application domains. In such cases, the underlying topology shapes statistical relationships, limiting the expressiveness of canonical PGMs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Colored Markov Random Fields (CMRFs), which model both conditional and marginal dependencies among Gaussian edge variables on topological spaces, with a theoretical foundation in Hodge theory. CMRFs extend classical Gaussian Markov Random Fields by including link coloring: connectivity encodes conditional independence, while color encodes marginal independence. We quantify the benefits of CMRFs through a distributed estimation case study over a physical network, comparing it with baselines with different levels of topological prior.

Abstract: Neural networks have become a widely adopted tool for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems from data. However, the choice of training strategy remains a key design decision, particularly for simulation tasks. This paper compares two predominant strategies: parallel and series-parallel training. The conducted empirical analysis spans five neural network architectures and two examples: a pneumatic valve test bench and an industrial robot benchmark. The study reveals that, even though series-parallel training dominates current practice, parallel training consistently yields better long-term prediction accuracy. Additionally, this work clarifies the often inconsistent terminology in the literature and relate both strategies to concepts from system identification. The findings suggest that parallel training should be considered the default training strategy for neural network-based simulation of dynamical systems.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between theoretical conceptualization and computational implementation is a major bottleneck in Scientific Computing (SciC) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating the computational design and production of materials. In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 °C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 °C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We show for invertible problems that transform data from a source domain (for example, Logic Condition Tables (LCTs)) to a destination domain (for example, Hardware Description Language (HDL) code), an approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a lossless encoder from source to destination followed by as a lossless decoder back to the source, comparable to lossless compression in information theory, can mitigate most of the LLM drawbacks of hallucinations and omissions. Specifically, using LCTs as inputs, we generate the full HDL for a two-dimensional network-on-chip router (13 units, 1500-2000 lines of code) using seven different LLMs, reconstruct the LCTs from the auto-generated HDL, and compare the original and reconstructed LCTs. This approach yields significant productivity improvements, not only confirming correctly generated LLM logic and detecting incorrectly generated LLM logic but also assisting developers in finding design specification errors.

TL;DR: Green AI导向的自适应分层冻结策略在联邦学习中显著降低MRI到CT转换任务的能耗与CO2排放，同时维持模型性能，平均节省可达23%，在多数架构上无显著性能下降，个别架构甚至提升。

Motivation: 联邦学习有望提升跨机构健康公平，但高资源需求往往排斥资源受限中心，扩大健康不平等。提出面向绿色AI的自适应层冻结以降低计算与能耗，同时保持诊断/转换性能。

Method: 在MRI到CT的联邦学习任务中，提出按轮次编码器权重相对差异自适应冻结，并通过基于耐心的机制仅在更新持续极小的情况下执行冻结；使用CodeCarbon跟踪能耗与CO2eq排放，并在多种FL架构下评估对比冻结/非冻结的性能与能耗差异。

Conclusion: 该工作支持在满足临床需求的同时实现可持续与公平的DL医疗应用，提出了可用于新FL评估框架的思路，为AI驱动的健康领域中的隐私保护、公平性与可持续性提供实践路径。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds the potential to advance equality in health by enabling diverse institutions to collaboratively train deep learning (DL) models, even with limited data. However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability. It lays the groundwork for novel FL evaluation frameworks, advancing privacy, equity and, more broadly, justice in AI-driven healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are very demanding in terms of their computational resources. Low-rank decompositions of LLM weights, e.g. via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is a promising approach for LLM compression, but presents several practical hurdles, e.g. selecting appropriate layer-wise ranks and getting rid of its parameter redundancy. In this work, we present two physics-inspired improvements to SVD LLM compression: (1) \textbf{FermiGrad}, a gradient-descent algorithm that determines globally optimal layer-wise ranks by relaxing the discrete singular-value truncation into a continuous optimization using the Fermi function; (2) \textbf{PivGa}, an additional \textit{lossless} compression of the low-rank factors that exploits the intrinsic gauge freedom in their parametrization.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of mortality, with coronary artery disease (CAD) as its most prevalent form, necessitating early risk prediction. While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce fluent but unsupported answers - hallucinations - limiting safe deployment in high-stakes domains. We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection. We position this work as a controlled mechanism study; broader validation across domains and naturally occurring hallucinations remains future work.

Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion (SD) drive a vibrant open-source ecosystem including fully fine-tuned checkpoints and parameter-efficient adapters such as LoRA, LyCORIS, and ControlNet. However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis. Code:~ https://github.com/Zhidong-Gao/DeltaSampling

Abstract: Agentic AI systems execute a sequence of actions, such as reasoning steps or tool calls, in response to a user prompt. To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of tokens in pre-trained Transformer models and explores their application to improving Transformers. To this end, we analyze the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the pre-trained model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. Specifically, we characterize when tokens move closer to or farther from one another over time, depending on the model parameters. We provide sufficient conditions, based on these parameters, to identify scenarios where tokens either converge to zero or diverge to infinity. Unlike prior works, our conditions are broader in scope and more applicable to real-world models. Furthermore, we investigate how different forms of positional encoding -- specifically absolute and rotary -- affect these dynamical regimes. Empirical evidence reveals that the convergence scenario adversely impacts model performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose simple refinements to Transformer architectures that mitigate convergence behavior in models with absolute or rotary positional encoding. These findings support theoretical foundations and design principles for improving Transformer models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Shapley values, a gold standard for feature attribution in Explainable AI, face two primary challenges. First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.

Abstract: The integration of Electric Buses (EBs) with renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) panels is a promising approach to promote sustainable and low-carbon public transportation. However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making. We develop a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian), which integrates Lagrangian relaxation into the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) framework. At the high level, we adopt a centralized PPO-Lagrangian algorithm to learn safe charger allocation policies. At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in both cost minimization and safety compliance, while maintaining fast convergence speed.

Analytic FL (AFL) provides a single-round, data distribution invariant solution, but is limited to linear models. Subsequent non-linear approaches, like DeepAFL, regain accuracy but sacrifice the single-round benefit. In this work, we break this trade-off. We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law. Empirically, SAFLe establishes a new state-of-the-art for analytic FL, significantly outperforming both linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL in accuracy across all benchmarks, demonstrating a highly efficient and scalable solution for federated vision.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) models relax the assumption that treatment effects are the same for every user. We present a large scale industrial framework for estimating HTE using experimental data from hundreds of millions of Snapchat users. By combining results across many experiments, the framework uncovers latent user characteristics that were previously unmeasurable and produces stable treatment effect estimates at scale.
  We describe the core components that enabled this system, including experiment selection, base learner design, and incremental training. We also highlight two applications: user influenceability to ads and user sensitivity to ads. An online A/B test using influenceability scores for targeting showed an improvement on key business metrics that is more than six times larger than what is typically considered significant.

Abstract: Online A/B testing, the gold standard for evaluating new advertising policies, consumes substantial engineering resources and risks significant revenue loss from deploying underperforming variations. This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance. This work contributes the first practical and validated framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, offering an efficient alternative to costly and risky online experiments.

Abstract: Recovering jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) setting is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but traditional methods like multiple measurement vectors orthogonal matching pursuit (M-OMP) and multiple measurement vectors FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (M-FOCUSS) often require careful parameter tuning or prior knowledge of the sparsity of the signal and/or noise variance. We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a "momentum-like" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to established methods without requiring any prior information or tuning.

Abstract: Generative AI agents in life sciences face a critical challenge: determining the optimal approach for diverse queries ranging from simple factoid questions to complex mechanistic reasoning. Traditional methods rely on fixed rules or expensive labeled training data, neither of which adapts to changing conditions or user preferences. We present a novel framework that combines AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits to enable AI agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies from user feedback alone. Our system optimizes three key dimensions: generation strategy selection (direct vs. chain-of-thought), tool selection (literature search, drug databases, etc.), and domain routing (pharmacology, molecular biology, clinical specialists). Through empirical evaluation on life science queries, we demonstrate 15-30\% improvement in user satisfaction compared to random baselines, with clear learning patterns emerging after 20-30 queries. Our approach requires no ground truth labels, adapts continuously to user preferences, and provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in agentic AI systems.

Abstract: We propose GaussDetect-LiNGAM, a novel approach for bivariate causal discovery that eliminates the need for explicit Gaussianity tests by leveraging a fundamental equivalence between noise Gaussianity and residual independence in the reverse regression. Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD). Our method enhances both the efficiency and practical applicability of causal inference, making LiNGAM more accessible and reliable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This article attempts answering the following problematic: How to model and classify energy consumption profiles over a large distributed territory to optimize the management of buildings' consumption?
  Doing case-by-case in depth auditing of thousands of buildings would require a massive amount of time and money as well as a significant number of qualified people. Thus, an automated method must be developed to establish a relevant and effective recommendations system.
  To answer this problematic, pretopology is used to model the sites' consumption profiles and a multi-criterion hierarchical classification algorithm, using the properties of pretopological space, has been developed in a Python library.
  To evaluate the results, three data sets are used: A generated set of dots of various sizes in a 2D space, a generated set of time series and a set of consumption time series of 400 real consumption sites from a French Energy company.
  On the point data set, the algorithm is able to identify the clusters of points using their position in space and their size as parameter. On the generated time series, the algorithm is able to identify the time series clusters using Pearson's correlation with an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 1.

Abstract: Existing class-incremental learning (CIL) approaches based on replay or knowledge distillation are often constrained by forgetting or the stability-plasticity dilemma. Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget.

Abstract: The advent of the big data paradigm has transformed how industries manage and analyze information, ushering in an era of unprecedented data volume, velocity, and variety. Within this landscape, mixed-data clustering has become a critical challenge, requiring innovative methods that can effectively exploit heterogeneous data types, including numerical and categorical variables. Traditional clustering techniques, typically designed for homogeneous datasets, often struggle to capture the additional complexity introduced by mixed data, underscoring the need for approaches specifically tailored to this setting. Hierarchical and explainable algorithms are particularly valuable in this context, as they provide structured, interpretable clustering results that support informed decision-making. This paper introduces a clustering method grounded in pretopological spaces. In addition, benchmarking against classical numerical clustering algorithms and existing pretopological approaches yields insights into the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method within the big data paradigm.

Abstract: Fuzzy simplicial sets have become an object of interest in dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, most prominently through their role in UMAP. However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.

Abstract: This article presents a novel pretopology-based algorithm designed to address the challenges of clustering mixed data without the need for dimensionality reduction. Leveraging Disjunctive Normal Form, our approach formulates customizable logical rules and adjustable hyperparameters that allow for user-defined hierarchical cluster construction and facilitate tailored solutions for heterogeneous datasets. Through hierarchical dendrogram analysis and comparative clustering metrics, our method demonstrates superior performance by accurately and interpretably delineating clusters directly from raw data, thus preserving data integrity. Empirical findings highlight the algorithm's robustness in constructing meaningful clusters and reveal its potential in overcoming issues related to clustered data explainability. The novelty of this work lies in its departure from traditional dimensionality reduction techniques and its innovative use of logical rules that enhance both cluster formation and clarity, thereby contributing a significant advancement to the discourse on clustering mixed data.

Abstract: Cross-entropy (CE) training loss dominates deep learning practice, yet existing theory often relies on simplifications, either replacing it with squared loss or restricting to convex models, that miss essential behavior. CE and squared loss generate fundamentally different dynamics, and convex linear models cannot capture the complexities of non-convex optimization. We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values. This technique opens a pathway for analyzing CE training dynamics well beyond our specific setting considered here.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in relational learning tasks, including node classification and link prediction. However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy. The datasets and source code will be publicly released at https://github.com/mtavassoli/GNN-FC.

Abstract: Tilted (entropic) risk, obtained by applying a log-exponential transform to a base loss, is a well established tool in statistics and machine learning for emphasizing rare or high loss events while retaining a tractable optimization problem. In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.

Abstract: The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly stimulated research interest in developing multi-modal LLM (MLLM)-based visual anomaly detection (VAD) algorithms that can be deployed in complex environments. The challenge is that in these complex environments, the anomalies are sometimes highly contextual and also ambiguous, and thereby, uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial capacity for an MLLM-based VAD system to succeed. In this paper, we introduce our UQ-supported MLLM-based VAD framework called ALARM. ALARM integrates UQ with quality-assurance techniques like reasoning chain, self-reflection, and MLLM ensemble for robust and accurate performance and is designed based on a rigorous probabilistic inference pipeline and computational process. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted using the real-world smart-home benchmark data and wound image classification data, which shows ALARM's superior performance and its generic applicability across different domains for reliable decision-making.

Abstract: Reliable real-time analysis of sensor data is essential for structural health monitoring (SHM) of high-value assets, yet a major challenge is to obtain spatially resolved full-field aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for trustworthy decision-making. We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances SHM toward trustworthy digital twin deployment and risk-aware structural diagnostics.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Generative Models (UMGMs) unify visual understanding and image generation within a single autoregressive framework. However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings. Codes will be publicly available: https://github.com/Christina200/MoDE-official.git

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for determining the structures of small molecules and is especially critical in the discovery of novel natural products and clinical therapeutics. Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products. ChefNMR predicts the structures of challenging natural product compounds with an unsurpassed accuracy of over 65%. This work takes a significant step toward solving the grand challenge of automating small-molecule structure elucidation and highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating molecular discovery.

Abstract: Wastewater-based genomic surveillance has emerged as a powerful tool for population-level viral monitoring, offering comprehensive insights into circulating viral variants across entire communities. However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability. Our reference-free framework provides a scalable, interpretable approach to genomic surveillance with direct applications to public health monitoring.

Result: 在若干具有挑战性的数学推理和编码基准上，Plantain 实现约 6% 的 pass@1 提升；相较于 think-then-answer 基线，首输出的时间-首次响应减少超过 60%。

Conclusion: 通过引入计划优先的中间输出，IR/Plantain 不仅提升了推理准确性，还显著降低了用户的感知等待时间，具有将逐步对齐机制推广到更广泛推理任务的潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning models often spend a significant amount of time thinking before they generate a visible response. In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard "think-then-answer" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines.

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods have received increased attention recently as a mechanism for learning to act in partially observable environments. They have shown promise for problems admitting memoryless policies but have been less successful when memory is required. In this paper we develop several improved algorithms for learning policies with memory in an infinite-horizon setting -- directly when a known model of the environment is available, and via simulation otherwise. We compare these algorithms on some large POMDPs, including noisy robot navigation and multi-agent problems.

Abstract: Network routing is a distributed decision problem which naturally admits numerical performance measures, such as the average time for a packet to travel from source to destination. OLPOMDP, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, was successfully applied to simulated network routing under a number of network models. Multiple distributed agents (routers) learned co-operative behavior without explicit inter-agent communication, and they avoided behavior which was individually desirable, but detrimental to the group's overall performance. Furthermore, shaping the reward signal by explicitly penalizing certain patterns of sub-optimal behavior was found to dramatically improve the convergence rate.

Abstract: Perch 2.0 is a supervised bioacoustics foundation model pretrained on 14,597 species, including birds, mammals, amphibians, and insects, and has state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Given that Perch 2.0 includes almost no marine mammal audio or classes in the training data, we evaluate Perch 2.0 performance on marine mammal and underwater audio tasks through few-shot transfer learning. We perform linear probing with the embeddings generated from this foundation model and compare performance to other pretrained bioacoustics models. In particular, we compare Perch 2.0 with previous multispecies whale, Perch 1.0, SurfPerch, AVES-bio, BirdAVES, and Birdnet V2.3 models, which have open-source tools for transfer-learning and agile modeling. We show that the embeddings from the Perch 2.0 model have consistently high performance for few-shot transfer learning, generally outperforming alternative embedding models on the majority of tasks, and thus is recommended when developing new linear classifiers for marine mammal classification with few labeled examples.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) that provide dense, step-level feedback have shown promise for reinforcement learning, yet their adoption remains limited by the need for expensive step-level annotations or ground truth references. We propose SPARK: a three-stage framework where in the first stage a generator model produces diverse solutions and a verifier model evaluates them using parallel scaling (self-consistency) and sequential scaling (meta-critique). In the second stage, we use these verification outputs as synthetic training data to fine-tune generative process reward models, which subsequently serve as reward signals during training. We show that aggregating multiple independent verifications at the step level produces training data for process reward models that surpass ground-truth outcome supervision, achieving 67.5 F1 on ProcessBench (a benchmark for identifying erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning) compared to 66.4 for reference-guided training and 61.9 for GPT-4o. In the final stage, we apply our generative PRM with chain-of-thought verification (PRM-CoT) as the reward model in RL experiments on mathematical reasoning, and introduce format constraints to prevent reward hacking. Using Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we achieve 47.4% average accuracy across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming ground-truth-based RLVR (43.9%). Our work enables reference-free RL training that exceeds ground-truth methods, opening new possibilities for domains lacking verifiable answers or accessible ground truth.

TL;DR: 多模态对齐中的事实回忆在VLM中普遍下降，早期实体解析速度决定是否能够复用LLM的事实回路；通过对14种模型的机制分析揭示问题并提出两种修复策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何将视觉输入对齐到预训练LLM的文本表示后，VLM的事实回忆往往低于原LLM骨干，提出“两跳”问题：先形成实体表征，再回忆相关事实。通过机制分析解释多模态对齐的系统性失败。

Method: 对14种VLM（涵盖LLaVA、Native、Cross-Attention等架构，大小7B–124B）在事实回忆任务上与原LLM骨干进行对比基准；从中选出3个降级较严重、2个降级较轻的模型，采用归因贴片、激活贴片和探针等手段，分析其是否能利用LLM骨干的现有事实回路，并考察第一跳实体解析的时点。

Result: 结果显示11/14模型存在事实回忆下降。高表现VLM能够更早解析实体并复用LLM的事实回路，低表现VLM因第一跳发生太晚而错过机会。提出两种恢复策略：从LLM骨干patch实体表示到VLM、以及通过chain-of-thought提示提升回忆。

Conclusion: 早期实体解析的速度是决定VLM是否能有效利用预先存在的LLM事实回路的关键；机械分析揭示多模态对齐中的系统性失败，并指向可通过对实体表示的干预或更具解释性的提示来缓解。

Abstract: Training vision language models (VLMs) aims to align visual representations from a vision encoder with the textual representations of a pretrained large language model (LLM). However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms. More broadly, our work illustrates how mechanistic analysis can explain and unveil systematic failures in multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite progress in machine learning-based aerodynamic surrogates, the scarcity of large, field-resolved datasets limits progress on accurate pointwise prediction and reproducible inverse design for aircraft. We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms. We expect BlendedNet++ to catalyze reproducible research in field-level aerodynamics and inverse design; resources (dataset, splits, baselines, and scripts) will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benefits various application domains, including health and elderly care. Traditional HAR involves constructing pipelines reliant on centralized user data, which can pose privacy concerns as they necessitate the uploading of user data to a centralized server. This work proposes multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) to enable: (1) privacy-aware ML; (2) joint ML model learning across devices with varying sampling frequency. We focus on head-worn devices (e.g., earbuds and smart glasses), a relatively unexplored domain compared to traditional smartwatch- or smartphone-based HAR. Results have shown improvements on two datasets against frequency-specific approaches, indicating a promising future in the multi-frequency FL-HAR task. The proposed network's implementation is publicly available for further research and development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPEN: an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features addresses spectral bias in PINNs, enabling accurate solving of CGLE where standard PINNs fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs suffer from spectral bias, making it hard to represent high-frequency components in stiff, multi-scale nonlinear PDEs; need a mechanism to adapt the spectral basis during training.

Method: Introduce ASPEN with an adaptive spectral layer that injects learnable Fourier features into the input, allowing the spectral basis to be tuned during training; apply to the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation (CGLE) and compare to standard PINN.

Result: Standard PINN diverges and exhibits non-physical oscillations on CGLE; ASPEN achieves accurate solutions with a low median physics residual of 5.10e-3 and a solution visually matching the ground truth; it also preserves physical properties like rapid free energy relaxation and long-term domain-wall stability.

Conclusion: Adaptive spectral basis enables a robust, physically consistent PINN-based solver for challenging dynamical systems where conventional PINNs fail, broadening the applicability of physics-informed ML.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful, mesh-free paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front. This work demonstrates that by incorporating an adaptive spectral basis, our framework provides a robust and physically-consistent solver for complex dynamical systems where standard PINNs fail, opening new options for machine learning in challenging physical domains.

Abstract: Regime transitions routinely break stationarity in time series, making calibrated uncertainty as important as point accuracy. We study distribution-free uncertainty for regime-switching forecasting by coupling Deep Switching State Space Models with Adaptive Conformal Inference (ACI) and its aggregated variant (AgACI). We also introduce a unified conformal wrapper that sits atop strong sequence baselines including S4, MC-Dropout GRU, sparse Gaussian processes, and a change-point local model to produce online predictive bands with finite-sample marginal guarantees under nonstationarity and model misspecification. Across synthetic and real datasets, conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and generally improved band efficiency.

TL;DR: HydroDCM 提出一种可扩展的跨水库域泛化框架，通过利用水库空间元数据构建伪域标签并进行对抗学习以获得不变的时序特征，在推断阶段以目标水库元数据进行轻量级条件化适应，显著优于现有域泛化 baselines，且计算高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在水文预测中，跨水库的分布差异导致模型在新水库上性能下降（域偏移）。传统域泛化方法难以应对大量水库的“many-domain”场景，因为每个水库存在独特的入流模式，同时空间位置信息等元数据间接但显著地影响入流，从而限制通用性。需一个可扩展且能结合元数据的域泛化框架。

Method: 利用水库的空间元数据构建伪域标签，使用对抗学习提取域不变的时序特征。在推断阶段，通过目标水库元数据驱动的轻量级条件层对特征进行调节，以实现域不变性与位置特定适应的结合。该框架具可扩展性，适用于多域水文环境。

Result: 在Upper Colorado River Basin的30个真实水库上进行实证，HydroDCM 相较于最先进的域泛化基线，在多域条件下显著提升预测性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: HydroDCM 提供了一个可扩展的水文跨水库域泛化解决方案，在维持不变性与局部适应之间取得平衡，适用于多域水文预测场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in reservoir inflow prediction, yet their performance often deteriorates when applied to different reservoirs due to distributional differences, referred to as the domain shift problem. Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation. Experiment results on 30 real-world reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art DG baselines under many-domain conditions and remains computationally efficient.

Abstract: The development of tabular foundation models (TFMs) has accelerated in recent years, showing strong potential to outperform traditional ML methods for structured data. A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone.

*Shanika Iroshi Nanayakkara,Shiva Raj Pokhrel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A2G introduces a dual-gain adaptive aggregation for quantum federated learning, combining a geometry gain for geometric blending and a QoS gain based on teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability, to improve convergence and robustness in heterogeneous/noisy environments. It unifies existing methods (FedAvg, QoS-aware, manifold-based aggregation) and is validated on a quantum-classical hybrid testbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning over quantum-enabled and heterogeneous classical networks suffers from uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation assumes Euclidean topology and uniform communication, which fails under quantum/network heterogeneity; there is a need for adaptive aggregation that accounts for topology, reliability, and device variations.

Method: Propose A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains) with two gains: a geometry gain that regulates the blend between local and global models (geometric blending) and a QoS gain that weights client updates by a QoS metric computed from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. Derive an A2G update rule, provide convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G reduces to FedAvg, QoS-aware averaging, and manifold-based aggregation in special cases. Validate on a quantum-classical hybrid testbed, demonstrating improved stability and accuracy under heterogeneity and noise.

Result: The paper provides convergence guarantees for A2G under standard assumptions and demonstrates empirically that A2G yields improved stability and higher accuracy in heterogeneous, noisy environments compared to baseline aggregations, while encompassing several known aggregation schemes as special cases.

Conclusion: A2G offers a unified, adaptable aggregation framework for quantum federated learning that can accommodate topology and reliability variations, recover existing methods as special cases, and improve performance in quantum-classical hybrid systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.

Abstract: Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face severe challenges due to heterogeneous network traffic, evolving cyber threats, and pronounced data imbalance between benign and attack flows. While generative models have shown promise in data augmentation, existing approaches are limited to single modalities and fail to capture cross-domain dependencies. This paper introduces MAGE-ID (Multimodal Attack Generator for Intrusion Detection), a diffusion-based generative framework that couples tabular flow features with their transformed images through a unified latent prior. By jointly training Transformer and CNN-based variational encoders with an EDM style denoiser, MAGE-ID achieves balanced and coherent multimodal synthesis. Evaluations on CIC-IDS-2017 and NSL-KDD demonstrate significant improvements in fidelity, diversity, and downstream detection performance over TabSyn and TabDDPM, highlighting the effectiveness of MAGE-ID for multimodal IDS augmentation.

Abstract: Graph classification is a fundamental task in domains ranging from molecular property prediction to materials design. While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Beneficial societal outcomes cannot be guaranteed by aligning individual AI systems with the intentions of their operators or users. Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.

Abstract: In this work we study how explicit world-modeling objectives affect the internal representations and downstream capability of Transformers across different training stages. We use a controlled 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and ask: (1) how does explicitly pretraining a world model affect the model's latent representations, and (2) how does world-model quality affect the model's performance after reinforcement learning post-training? We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states. Our results indicate that sharpening state representations can improve the effectiveness of post-training for sequence-planning tasks.

We ask whether this training regime also helps with machine unlearning, i.e., removing the influence of specified data without full retraining. We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting. Our results highlight when a model is trained (pre- vs. post-grokking) as an orthogonal lever to how unlearning is performed, providing a practical recipe to improve existing unlearning methods without altering their algorithms.

Abstract: In recent years, financial sentiment analysis of public opinion has become increasingly important for market forecasting and risk assessment. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent. These results highlight the potential of our framework to support more accurate financial decision-making and risk management.

Abstract: Chronic diseases often progress differently across patients. Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.

Abstract: The global rise in type 2 diabetes underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective screening methods. Current diagnosis requires biochemical assays, which are invasive and costly. Advances in consumer wearables have enabled early explorations of machine learning-based disease detection, but prior studies were limited to controlled settings. We present SweetDeep, a compact neural network trained on physiological and demographic data from 285 (diabetic and non-diabetic) participants in the EU and MENA regions, collected using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions over six days. Each participant contributed multiple 2-minute sensor recordings per day, totaling approximately 20 recordings per individual. Despite comprising fewer than 3,000 parameters, SweetDeep achieves 82.5% patient-level accuracy (82.1% macro-F1, 79.7% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity) under three-fold cross-validation, with an expected calibration error of 5.5%. Allowing the model to abstain on less than 10% of low-confidence patient predictions yields an accuracy of 84.5% on the remaining patients. These findings demonstrate that combining engineered features with lightweight architectures can support accurate, rapid, and generalizable detection of type 2 diabetes in real-world wearable settings.

Abstract: Event-based models (EBMs) infer disease progression from cross-sectional data, and standard EBMs assume a single underlying disease per individual. In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.

Abstract: We propose Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), a neurosymbolic framework that integrates deep learning with the formal semantics of modal logic, enabling reasoning about necessity and possibility. Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\Box$ and $\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.
  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides an attractive solution for large-area tactile sensing due to its minimal wiring and shape flexibility, but its nonlinear inverse problem often leads to severe artifacts and inaccurate contact reconstruction. This work presents PhyDNN, a physics-driven deep reconstruction framework that embeds the EIT forward model directly into the learning objective. By jointly minimizing the discrepancy between predicted and ground-truth conductivity maps and enforcing consistency with the forward PDE, PhyDNN reduces the black-box nature of deep networks and improves both physical plausibility and generalization. To enable efficient backpropagation, we design a differentiable forward-operator network that accurately approximates the nonlinear EIT response, allowing fast physics-guided training. Extensive simulations and real tactile experiments on a 16-electrode soft sensor show that PhyDNN consistently outperforms NOSER, TV, and standard DNNs in reconstructing contact shape, location, and pressure distribution. PhyDNN yields fewer artifacts, sharper boundaries, and higher metric scores, demonstrating its effectiveness for high-quality tomographic tactile sensing.

Abstract: Compressed sensing enables sparse sampling but relies on generic bases and random measurements, limiting efficiency and reconstruction quality. Optimal sensor placement uses historcal data to design tailored sampling patterns, yet its fixed, linear bases cannot adapt to nonlinear or sample-specific variations. Generative model-based compressed sensing improves reconstruction using deep generative priors but still employs suboptimal random sampling. We propose an adaptive sparse sensing framework that couples a variational autoencoder prior with reinforcement learning to select measurements sequentially. Experiments show that this approach outperforms CS, OSP, and Generative model-based reconstruction from sparse measurements.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their state-of-the-art performance in generating synthetic images. However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA.

Abstract: Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.
  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) alignment provide interpretable geometric frameworks for comparing, transforming, and aggregating heterogeneous datasets -- tasks ubiquitous in data science and machine learning. Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to enhance neural network performance when training data and application data are not very similar, e.g., out of distribution problems, as well as pattern and regime shifts. The method consists of three main steps: 1) Retrain the neural network towards reasonable subsets of the training data set and note down the resulting weight anomalies. 2) Choose reasonable predictors and derive a regression between the predictors and the weight anomalies. 3) Extrapolate the weights, and thereby the neural network, to the application data. We show and discuss this method in three use cases from the climate sciences, which include successful temporal, spatial and cross-domain extrapolations of neural networks.

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is essential for demand management and smart grid operations. This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal representations with complementary deep learning structures. To our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly evaluate temporal encodings, calendar-based features, and hybrid ensemble architectures within a unified short-term energy forecasting framework.

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a powerful method for guiding the behavior of generative models towards desired outcomes such as toxicity mitigation. However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much.

Abstract: While tabular machine learning has achieved remarkable success, temporal distribution shifts pose significant challenges in real-world deployment, as the relationships between features and labels continuously evolve. Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data.

Abstract: We propose a novel QTGNN framework for detecting fraudulent transactions in large-scale financial networks. By integrating quantum embedding, variational graph convolutions, and topological data analysis, QTGNN captures complex transaction dynamics and structural anomalies indicative of fraud. The methodology includes quantum data embedding with entanglement enhancement, variational quantum graph convolutions with non-linear dynamics, extraction of higher-order topological invariants, hybrid quantum-classical anomaly learning with adaptive optimization, and interpretable decision-making via topological attribution. Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning. QTGNN offers a theoretically sound, interpretable, and practical solution for financial fraud detection, bridging quantum machine learning, graph theory, and topological analysis.

Abstract: Urban transportation systems face increasing resilience challenges from extreme weather events, but current assessment methods rely on surface-level recovery indicators that miss hidden structural damage. Existing approaches cannot distinguish between true recovery and "false recovery," where traffic metrics normalize, but the underlying system dynamics permanently degrade. To address this, a new physics-constrained Hamiltonian learning algorithm combining "structural irreversibility detection" and "energy landscape reconstruction" has been developed. Our approach extracts low-dimensional state representations, identifies quasi-Hamiltonian structures through physics-constrained optimization, and quantifies structural changes via energy landscape comparison. Analysis of London's extreme rainfall in 2021 demonstrates that while surface indicators were fully recovered, our algorithm detected 64.8\% structural damage missed by traditional monitoring. Our framework provides tools for proactive structural risk assessment, enabling infrastructure investments based on true system health rather than misleading surface metrics.

Abstract: Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.

Abstract: Urban analytics increasingly relies on AI-driven trajectory analysis, yet current approaches suffer from methodological fragmentation: trajectory learning captures movement patterns but ignores spatial context, while spatial embedding methods encode street networks but miss temporal dynamics. Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \to B \ne B \to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems.

Abstract: Optimization methods play a central role in signal processing, serving as the mathematical foundation for inference, estimation, and control. While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.

Abstract: Smartphones and smartwatches are ever-present in daily life, and provide a rich source of information on their users' behaviour. In particular, digital traces derived from the phone's embedded movement sensors present an opportunity for a forensic investigator to gain insight into a person's physical activities. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to translate digital traces into likelihood ratios (LRs) for different types of physical activities. Evaluating on a new dataset, NFI\_FARED, which contains digital traces from four different types of iPhones labelled with 19 activities, it was found that our approach could produce useful LR systems to distinguish 167 out of a possible 171 activity pairings. The same approach was extended to analyse likelihoods for multiple activities (or groups of activities) simultaneously and create activity timelines to aid in both the early and latter stages of forensic investigations. The dataset and all code required to replicate the results have also been made public to encourage further research on this topic.

Abstract: Clinical pathways are specialized healthcare plans that model patient treatment procedures. They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications. The results show that our method enables expanding the knowledge base of clinical pathways with sufficient precision, peaking to 95.62% AUC while maintaining an arc-degree simplicity of 67.11%.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram is a useful diagnostic signal that can detect cardiac abnormalities by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart. Due to its rapid, non-invasive, and richly informative characteristics, ECG has many emerging applications. In this paper, we study novel deep learning technologies to effectively manage and analyse ECG data, with the aim of building a diagnostic model, accurately and quickly, that can substantially reduce the burden on medical workers. Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types. On top of that, we next propose a cross-attention-based feature fusion model of EfficientECG for analysing multi-lead ECG data with multiple features (e.g., gender and age). Our evaluations on representative ECG datasets validate the superiority of our model against state-of-the-art works in terms of high precision, multi-feature fusion, and lightweights.

Abstract: Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) studies the efficient identification of control policies for parameterized optimization algorithms. Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($λ$,$λ$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude.

Abstract: When using an LLM through an API provider, users expect the served model to remain consistent over time, a property crucial for the reliability of downstream applications and the reproducibility of research. Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world.

Abstract: Decision support systems often rely on solving complex optimization problems that may require to estimate uncertain parameters beforehand. Recent studies have shown how using traditionally trained estimators for this task can lead to suboptimal solutions. Using the actual decision cost as a loss function (called Decision Focused Learning) can address this issue, but with a severe loss of scalability at training time. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation. In our results, the method reduces costly inner solver calls, with a solution quality comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing can significantly improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption, yet the energy demands of AI models may offset these gains. This study utilizes in-situ sensing-based prediction of geometric quality in smart machining to compare the energy consumption, accuracy, and speed of common AI models. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) is introduced as an alternative, achieving accuracy comparable to conventional models while drastically reducing energy consumption, 200$\times$ for training and 175 to 1000$\times$ for inference. Furthermore, HDC reduces training times by 200$\times$ and inference times by 300 to 600$\times$, showcasing its potential for energy-efficient smart manufacturing.

Abstract: We introduce Density-Informed VAE (DiVAE), a lightweight, data-driven regularizer that aligns the VAE log-prior probability $\log p_Z(z)$ with a log-density estimated from data. Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions. This is realized by adding a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, incurring negligible computational overhead. On synthetic datasets, DiVAE (i) improves distributional alignment of latent log-densities to its ground truth counterpart, (ii) improves prior coverage, and (iii) yields better OOD uncertainty calibration. On MNIST, DiVAE improves alignment of the prior with external estimates of the density, providing better interpretability, and improves OOD detection for learnable priors.

Abstract: In the vision domain, dataset distillation arises as a technique to condense a large dataset into a smaller synthetic one that exhibits a similar result in the training process. While image data presents an extensive literature of distillation methods, text dataset distillation has fewer works in comparison. Text dataset distillation initially grew as an adaptation of efforts from the vision universe, as the particularities of the modality became clear obstacles, it rose into a separate branch of research. Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications. In this report, we review past and recent advances in dataset distillation for text, highlighting different distillation strategies, key contributions, and general challenges.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often relies on behavior regularization that enforces policies to remain close to the dataset distribution. However, such approaches fail to distinguish between high-value and low-value actions in their regularization components. We introduce Guided Flow Policy (GFP), which couples a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor. The actor directs the flow policy through weighted behavior cloning to focus on cloning high-value actions from the dataset rather than indiscriminately imitating all state-action pairs. In turn, the flow policy constrains the actor to remain aligned with the dataset's best transitions while maximizing the critic. This mutual guidance enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.

Abstract: Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) becomes challenging when probe-vehicle penetration is low and observations are spatially sparse. Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields. This PEGP framework combines physical priors, uncertainty quantification, which can provide reliable support for TSE.

Abstract: Training with differential privacy (DP) provides a guarantee to members in a dataset that they cannot be identified by users of the released model. However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training. This leads to the first known DP-SCO algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility whose DP verification scales better than training cost, significantly reducing verification costs on large datasets.

Abstract: Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models require immense computational resources, motivating research into low-precision training. Quantised training addresses this by representing training components in low-bit integers, but typically relies on discretising real-valued updates. We introduce an alternative approach where the update rule itself is discrete, avoiding the quantisation of continuous updates by design. We establish convergence guarantees for a general class of such discrete schemes, and present a multinomial update rule as a concrete example, supported by empirical evaluation. This perspective opens new avenues for efficient training, particularly for models with inherently discrete structure.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: To handle underspecified or ambiguous queries, AI assistants need a policy for managing their uncertainty to determine (a) when to guess the user intent and answer directly, (b) when to enumerate and answer multiple possible intents, and (c) when to ask a clarifying question. However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy. Moreover, our procedure also generalizes to numerical cost values that were unobserved at training time.
