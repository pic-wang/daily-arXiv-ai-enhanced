Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline. Further analysis indicates that TabSieve concentrates more attention on the selected evidence, which improves robustness to noisy context."}

Existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation (Neural CDE) approaches, while effective at modelling continuous dynamics, suffer from slow, inherently sequential computation, which restricts scalability and limits access to global context. We introduce UFO (U-Former ODE), a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates the parallelizable, multiscale feature extraction of U-Nets, the powerful global modelling of Transformers, and the continuous-time dynamics of Neural CDEs. By constructing a fully causal, parallelizable model, UFO achieves a global receptive field while retaining strong sensitivity to local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy. Moreover, UFO delivers up to 15$\\times$ faster inference compared to conventional Neural CDEs, with consistently strong performance on long and highly multivariate sequences."}
