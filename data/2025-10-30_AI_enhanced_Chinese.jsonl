To analyze the impact\nof such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare\ndisease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This,\nhowever, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the\nobservation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age\nranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the\napplication of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression.\nWe tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned\nlow-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across\ninstruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder\narchitectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time\npoint. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured\nthrough a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To\nenable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach\nthat accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression\nand variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact\nof treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy.

A classification\nmodel is said to be well calibrated if its predicted probabilities correspond\nwith the rates events actually occur.

The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse\napproximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the\nspectral-norm error $\\| (\\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \\|$ for an $n\\times n$\nsymmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\\(p\\)\napproximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.\nUnder mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic\nperturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,\nspectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$.

However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified\narchitectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), data models (e.g., linear regression with\nisotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to\nrealistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with\nnonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with\nheterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where\nthe MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single\ngradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional\nasymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to\nstructured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of\nGaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that\nnonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear\ntasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data\nmixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low\nnoise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when\nthe task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated\nempirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data\ndistributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving\nmultilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different\nsource. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings\nextend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical\nfoundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the\nrole of architecture and data in ICL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank\napproximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a\ndata-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius\nnorm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or\nunder-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,\ncaptures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility\nguarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds\nfor symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem\nand explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$.

In this\nwork, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a\ncase for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization\nacross interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome\ngenerating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations\ncan effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating\nmechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect\nestimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved\nconfounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of\ntreatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.\nHowever, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which\nis the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based\nestimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating\nconfounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even\nwhen certain IV properties are relaxed.

We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative).

We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that\ntreats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the\nunconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we\naccumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic\ncontroller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a\nuser-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into\nan evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.\nImportantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard\nepsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes\nnaturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the\nunconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum\nfrom exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions\nconsistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional\nout-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that\nintegrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more\ninterpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684Transformer\u5f0f\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08CPD\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230Option-Critic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316HRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5272\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eCPD\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9009\u9879\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "HRL\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u9879\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u53d8\u70b9\uff09\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u9009\u9879\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5728Option-Critic\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757CPD\uff1b\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u6f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9CPD\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u70b9\u3002\u53d8\u70b9\u7528\u4e8e\uff1a(i) \u7a33\u5b9a\u7ec8\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c(ii) \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c(iii) \u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u9009\u9879\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u60e9\u7f5a\u5728CPD\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u533a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u6807\u51c6actor-critic\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u53e0\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Four-Rooms \u4e0e Pinball \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCPD \u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7d2f\u8ba1\u56de\u62a5\u4ee5\u53ca\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9009\u9879\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u70b9\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8HRL\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7CPD\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u533a\uff09\u878d\u5165HRL\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5206\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we\nsystematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key\ncomponents that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the\nboard, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise\ncounterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral\ndescent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not\nexplained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP\ndisplays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends\nalong the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that\nmatrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of\nmatrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.\nExperiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently\noutperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of\nMuon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while\nlookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance\nestimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u77e9\u9635 whitening \u4f18\u5316\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1b\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u89e3\u6784\u77e9\u9635 whitening \u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u77e9\u9635 whitening \u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u5982 SOAP\u3001Muon \u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982 Adam\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22 Lookahead \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u77e9\u9635 whitening \u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e Adam \u7b49\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u4e86\u589e\u76ca\uff0cSOAP \u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6bcf\u6b65\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u662f\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7248\u672c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0b\u964d\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684 Muon\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a Lookahead \u4e0d\u5982\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u662f\u77e9\u9635 whitening \u6210\u529f\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5171\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u4f4e\u79e9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce SPIRE\n(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that\nfactorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel\nalignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE\nrobustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external\nperturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,\nSPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions\nand temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation\n(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode\nstimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.\nThese results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing\nmulti-region neural dynamics under stimulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPIRE \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u533a\u57df\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u57fa\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u91cd\u7ec4\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e DBS \u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u523a\u6fc0\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u533a\u57df\u795e\u7ecf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u523a\u6fc0\uff09\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SPIRE\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u4ec5\u57fa\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6709\u5730\u9762 truth \u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645 DBS \u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cSPIRE \u76f8\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u5728\u6df1\u8111\u523a\u6fc0\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u523a\u6fc0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e0e\u8de8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SPIRE \u4e3a\u591a\u533a\u57df\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u523a\u6fc0\u5e72\u9884\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u63ed\u793a\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

However, identifying the worst-case adversarial\nexamples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation\nmethods have shown success in neural network verification to address this\nchallenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.\nFurthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight\nlocal Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.\nOriginally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was\nproposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and\ncomplete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity\ngrafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than\nreducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require\nrelaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the\n$l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear\nactivation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a\ntighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we\npropose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant\napproximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz\nconstant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified\ntraining. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into\nthese influential activations tightens the $l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant\nand enhances certified robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7d27\u5316 l_infty \u5c40\u90e8 Lipschitz \u5e38\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8 Lipschitz \u5e38\u6570\u3002\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u574f\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u662f NP-hard\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c/\u653e\u5bbd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7d27\u754c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027 grafting \u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4ece l_infty \u5c40\u90e8 Lipschitz \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Lipschitz-aware \u7684\u7ebf\u6027 grafting\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u7ebf\u6027 grafting \u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u6765 tightening \u5c40\u90e8 Lipschitz\uff1b\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8 l_infty \u5c40\u90e8 Lipschitz \u7684\u7d27\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027 grafting \u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e Lipschitz \u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have\nsmaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further\nadvance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the\n\\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play\nframework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update\ncomponents projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing\nstability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting\nconvergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both\npractical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key\ninnovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on\nhistorical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that\napplies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA\ncomputationally tractable and highly effective.
