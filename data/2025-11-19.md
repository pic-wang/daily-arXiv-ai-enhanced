### [1] [Extended Physics Informed Neural Network for Hyperbolic Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13734)
*Saif Ur Rehman,Wajid Yousuf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XPINN solves Buckley-Leverett nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs by spatial-temporal domain decomposition into pre- and post-shock regions with Rankine-Hugoniot coupling, enabling accurate shocks with smaller networks and no artificial diffusion; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures challenge traditional solvers; standard PINNs struggle with sharp fronts. A scalable, physics-informed approach that preserves shock physics is needed for efficient multiphase flow modeling.

Method: Extend PINN by decomposing the computational domain in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions. Train localized subnetworks for each region; couple them via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to enforce flux continuity at the moving shock interface. No artificial diffusion or entropy corrections used. Use fewer trainable parameters per subnetwork for efficiency.

Result: Numerical experiments show accurate capture of discontinuous saturation fronts and nonlinear wave interactions, improved stability, faster convergence, and higher resolution with smaller, domain-specific models compared to standard PINNs.

Conclusion: XPINN is an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow, offering accurate shock capturing without artificial diffusion and with computational efficiency. GitHub implementation provided.

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

### [2] [Radial Compensation: Stable and Semantically Decoupled Generative Models on Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14056)
*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Radial Compensation (RC) decouples curvature from model parameters in manifold generative models by selecting a tangent-space base density, enabling likelihoods that depend only on geodesic distance. It introduces Balanced-Exponential (bExp) charts, which preserve density and Fisher information across settings; RC reduces gradient variance and flow cost, improving stability and test likelihoods across densities, VAEs, flows on images/graphs, and proteins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but introduce stiff, curvature-sensitive Jacobians; volume-preserving charts preserve densities but distort geodesic distances. Both entangle curvature with parameters, inflating gradient variance, and radius blow-ups in high-dimensional latent flows harm likelihoods and optimization.

Method: Introduce Radial Compensation (RC): choose the base density in the tangent space so the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. Allow radial parameters to stay meaningful in geodesic units while the chart acts as a numerical preconditioner. Extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume. Prove RC is the unique construction yielding curvature-invariant Fisher information for geodesic-radial likelihoods. Derive Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information; smaller dial values reduce gradient variance and flow cost.

Result: Theoretical: RC yields curvature-invariant Fisher information and a unique geodesic-radial likelihood construction. Practical: bExp charts under RC maintain density and Fisher information regardless of dial, with smaller dials lowering gradient variance and computation cost. Empirical: RC enables stable generative modeling across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models; improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows.

Conclusion: RC–bExp provides a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds by decoupling curvature from parameters, preserving manifold density and Fisher information, and reducing gradient variance and compute while maintaining geodesic interpretation.

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

### [3] [Synthetic Survival Control: Extending Synthetic Controls for "When-If" Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14133)
*Jessy Xinyi Han,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) 来在多时间点的面板数据中对生存结果进行因果推断，通过对单位的对照加权平均来估计反事实危险轨迹，且给出识别与有限样本保证；在多国癌症治疗数据中验证，显示新治疗能降低后干预风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在观察性数据中估计时间到事件的因果效应面临删失、样本规模和混杂等挑战，需回答“若干预在某时点发生，事件时点会如何改变”的问题，且治疗采用具有异质性的现实情境。

Method: 在面板数据中构建低秩结构的因果生存分析框架；SSC 将目标单位的反事实危险轨迹表示为来自其他单位的观测轨迹的加权组合；提供识别性证明和有限样本保证；并在逐步引入新疗法的多国数据上进行验证。

Conclusion: 为观测数据中的因果生存推断提供一个通用、可解释的工具，适用于医学、经济和公共政策领域。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

### [4] [Blurred Encoding for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13741)
*Silin Zhou,Yao Chen,Shuo Shang,Lisi Chen,Bingsheng He,Ryosuke Shibasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLUE proposes a hierarchical patch encoding for GPS trajectories: progressively coarser patches create a pyramid; encoder-decoder with Transformer per level learns embeddings; trained with trajectory reconstruction (MSE); outperforms 8 SOTA TRL methods across 3 tasks by ~30.9% on average; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TRL methods lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details when compressing GPS points into grid cells or road segments. A multi-level patch representation can preserve details at low levels while capturing global patterns at high levels.

Method: BLUE builds a pyramid of patches by gradually reducing GPS coordinate precision. At each level, a Transformer learns the trajectory embedding; pooling aggregates to the next higher level in the encoder, while up-resolution guides the lower level in the decoder. The model is trained end-to-end on a trajectory reconstruction task using MSE. The approach is compared against 8 SOTA TRL methods on 3 downstream tasks.

Result: BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, with an average improvement of 30.90% over the best-performing baselines across the tasks.

Conclusion: A pyramid, multi-level patch encoding with Transformer-based level embeddings, coupled with reconstruction training, yields superior trajectory representations by preserving fine-grained details and modeling high-level travel patterns; code is available at the given GitHub URL.

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/slzhou-xy/BLUE.

### [5] [SCALEX: Scalable Concept and Latent Exploration for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13750)
*E. Zhixuan Zeng,Yuhao Chen,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCALEX is a framework for scalable, automated exploration of diffusion-model latent spaces using natural-language prompts to extract semantically meaningful directions, enabling zero-shot bias analysis without retraining or labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias analysis in diffusion models is limited by predefined categories and manual interpretation of latent directions. A scalable, automated approach is needed to systematically discover and compare biases across arbitrary concepts.

Method: Extracts semantically meaningful directions in H-space via natural-language prompts (zero-shot), links prompts to latent directions, enables large-scale discovery and cross-concept comparison without retraining or labeling.

Result: SCALEX enables detection of gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision, improving scalability and interpretability of bias analysis in diffusion models.

Conclusion: By connecting prompts to latent directions, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior methods, enabling broad, unsupervised discovery of internal associations.

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

Method: 在黑箱设置下，提出单特征差分进化攻击，对周围车辆的单一运动学特征进行扰动，并将扰动注入LLM输入提示中；在高D数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 即使扰动很小且物理上合理，也会显著干扰模型输出，揭示LLM驱动的预测器易受对抗 manipulation 的影响；并揭示准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡，分析失败机制并探讨缓解方案。

Conclusion: 首次提供了LLM驱动的自动驾驶模型在车辆交互场景中的对抗脆弱性初步洞察，强调在未来的智能交通系统设计中引入面向鲁棒性的防御与评估。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

### [7] [Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13755)
*Zhe Yang,Wenrui Li,Hongtao Chen,Penghong Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RedReg, an adaptive redundancy regulation method to balance multimodal learning by using an information-bottleneck-inspired framework with a redundancy phase monitor and co-information gating, plus gradient projection to suppress dominant modality when redundancy is high; shows robust improvements across major baselines and scenarios with ablations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modality bias in joint multimodal training where the advantaged modality dominates backpropagation, causing long-term decoupling and redundant information; existing methods uniformly adjust gradients ignoring cross-modal semantics.

Method: Introduce redundancy phase monitor: triggers interventions when redundancy and effective gain growth rate indicate high redundancy. Introduce co-information gating to quantify the current dominant modality's contribution using cross-modal semantics; disable suppression when task relies on a single modality. Project the dominant modality gradient onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and apply suppression proportional to redundancy.

Result: Empirical results show RedReg outperforms major existing methods in most scenarios. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of individual components. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: RedReg provides a principled, dynamic mechanism to regulate redundant information and balance cross-modal representations, improving training stability and performance in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Intraoperative monitoring and prediction of vital signs are critical for ensuring patient safety and improving surgical outcomes. Despite recent advances in deep learning models for medical time-series forecasting, several challenges persist, including the lack of standardized benchmarks, incomplete data, and limited cross-center validation. To address these challenges, we introduce VitalBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for intraoperative vital sign prediction.

This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling. This work lays the foundation for advancing predictive models for intraoperative vital sign forecasting, ensuring that these models are not only accurate but also robust and adaptable across diverse clinical environments.

Conclusion: ChemFixer在深度药物发现流程中展现出实际潜力，适用于数据有限情境并可扩展到多种下游任务，能增强分子的有效性并扩展可访问的化学空间。

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量标注数据匮乏和 Offensive 内容的低发生率导致现有方法难以获得良好性能，因此需要在无标注数据上充分利用信息。

Method: 以轻量分类器起步，结合 MA-VLMs 进行伪标签协同生成；将 unlabeled 数据分为 Agreed-Unknown 和 Disagreed-Unknown；MA-VLMs 模拟 moderator 与 user 两个视角；提出 Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) 损失，利用有标签、Agreed-Unknown、Disagreed-Unknown 数据并抑制伪标签噪声。

Result: 在基准数据集上，所提出框架在少监督条件下明显优于基线，且接近大规模模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同伪标签与 PNU 损失，有效提升低资源条件下的 Offensive 内容检测性能，展示了 MA-VLMs 与自训练的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 MoETTA：一种基于熵的待推理适应框架，结合专家式模型（MoE）实现对混合分布偏移的多方向梯度更新，以应对真实场景中的异构域变化。引入 potpourri 与 potpourri+ 两套基准，前者覆盖自然、艺术、对抗性等多样域偏移，后者还包含源域样本以评估灾难性遗忘。实验在三种混合分布偏移场景下显示优于强 baseline，达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中测试数据往往呈现多样且互相冲突的域因素（异构混合分布偏移），单一统一的参数更新路径无法有效适应所有样本的最佳梯度方向。因此需要在待推理阶段通过多专家结构实现对不同域的专门适配。

Method: 在测试时引入 Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）架构，设计结构上解耦的若干专家模块以实现对不同域的梯度更新路径解耦；利用基于熵的门控或选择机制在不同样本上分发更新方向，从而产生多样化的参数更新。并提出 potpourri 与 potpourri+ 两个更贴近真实场景的基准来评估混合分布偏移下的适应能力。

Result: 在三类混合分布偏移设置下，MoETTA持续超越强基线，达到SOTA水平，验证了通过专家层面的多样化适应方向来提升鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: 将MoE与熵控制的待推理适配相结合能显著提升对异构分布偏移的适应性能，且新基准更好地模拟真实部署场景，为未来TTA研究提供了强有力的评估与方法方向。

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

### [14] [PROF: An LLM-based Reward Code Preference Optimization Framework for Offline Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13765)
*Shengjie Sun,Jiafei Lyu,Runze Liu,Mengbei Yan,Bo Liu,Deheng Ye,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework named PROF uses LLMs to generate executable reward function codes from natural language and a single expert trajectory, with a Reward Preference Ranking (RPR) to rank reward candidates without environment interaction, alternating with text-based gradient optimization to automate reward selection for offline imitation learning; shows strong results on D4RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the weak assumption in offline IL that trajectory similarity to expert implies higher reward, and the need for robust reward discovery without extensive environment interactions.

Method: Generate multiple reward function candidates via LLMs from natural language and a single expert trajectory; assess and rank them with Reward Preference Ranking (RPR) without environment interaction; iteratively refine reward functions using text-based gradient optimization; select the top reward function for downstream policy learning.

Result: Empirical evaluation on D4RL shows PROF outperforms or matches recent strong baselines across multiple datasets and domains.

Conclusion: Automatic reward function discovery via LLMs and RPR enables robust offline IL by efficiently selecting and refining reward signals without requiring costly environment interactions.

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CED 将深度集成压缩为单模型 CREDIT，通过输出类级概率区间来定义概率分布的可信集合以进行不确定性量化；在OOD检测任务中实现更优或等效的不确定性估计，同时显著降低推断成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成在量化预测不确定性方面表现突出，但推断阶段的计算与内存开销高，限制实际广泛部署，需要高效的替代方案。

Method: 将深度集成压缩为单模型 CREDIT，输出类级概率区间而非单一 softmax 概率，这些区间定义一个凸集合（credal set）用于不确定性量化；通过对单模型的训练使其拟合来自集成的区间，从而实现对不确定性的有效估计

Result: 在OOD检测基准上，CED 的不确定性估计优于或接近多种基线，并在推断阶段相较于深度集成实现显著成本降低

Conclusion: CED 提供一种在不显著牺牲不确定性质量的前提下压缩推断成本的单模型不确定性量化框架；区间化的 credal set 为分类任务的鲁棒性和可靠性提升提供了一种可行路径

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出动态温度调度(DTS)的知识蒸馏方法：根据教师与学生分布的散度动态调节温度，克服固定温度的局限，在视觉与NLP任务上优于静态基线，代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定温度在KD中的子最优性，以及教师与学生在结构差异导致的对数输出幅度不匹配问题。希望训练早期采用更软的概率、后期使用更尖的概率，以提高蒸馏效果。

Method: 提出DTS，根据教师-学生之间的交叉熵损失差（CE gap）动态调整温度，能够与现有KD框架无缝结合；在多种KD策略和任务上进行验证。

Result: 在视觉数据集CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet以及自然语言处理任务GLUE、Dolly、SelfIns、UnNI、S-NI等上，DTS持续优于固定温度的基线，且代码公开。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于教师-学生分布差异自适应温度的蒸馏调度方法，具备良好泛化性和易集成性，能提升多种KD场景下的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Sibgat-Ul/DTS.

Motivation: 解释自注意力的原理与 Transformer 的结构来源，将分布式语义（如 GloVe 的共现统计）与序列建模联系起来，提供对注意力机制的统一理解。

Method: 从支撑 GloVe 的共现矩阵出发，阐释如何将共现统计投影到序列上下文中，推导出查询-键-值机制作为对方向性关系的天然不对称扩展；将位置编码和多头注意力视为对这一投影原则的结构化改进。

Result: 提供了自注意力和 Transformer 结构的数学关联，显示其代数形式源自投影原则而非任意设计选择，提升对模型内部机制的理论理解。

Conclusion: Transformer 的代数形式是基于投影原则的自然结果，而非凭空设计；分布式语义视角为理解注意力机制与序列建模提供统一框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

*Emanuel Covaci,Fabian Galis,Radu Balan,Daniela Zaharie,Darian Onchis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes differentiable global explainability by integrating feature importance into model training via ScoresActivation, enabling end-to-end training with feature ranking aligned to SHAP values and ground-truth importance, achieving fast ranking and improved accuracy with selective features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post hoc explanations are disconnected from training, limiting faithfulness and utility. A differentiable, training-time feature importance mechanism can yield globally faithful explanations without sacrificing performance.

Method: Introduce a ScoresActivation function as a feature-ranking mechanism embedded in the learning pipeline. The model learns to prioritize features by their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable, end-to-end trainable manner, yielding globally faithful feature rankings.

Result: Feature rankings are globally faithful and stable, aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth importance. Predictive performance remains high. Feature scoring is ~150x faster than SHAP (2 seconds vs 300 seconds for ranking in the same configuration). Classification accuracy improves by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant).

Conclusion: Integrates explainability into training to bridge accuracy and interpretability, providing a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

Motivation: CIL 面临灾难性忘却；预训练模型可固定特征提取，但需要随任务增量地适配特征；希望在不训练梯度的情况下实现特征的增量自适应与高效分类器的结合。

Method: Analytic Contrastive Projection (AnaCP)：在固定的 PTM 特征提取器基础上，通过分析投影实现增量特征自适应，同时保持分析分类器结构，避免梯度更新；采用对比学习目标辅助与投影策略提升跨任务特征一致性。

Result: 实验结果显示 AnaCP 超越现有基线，达到接近联合训练的准确率，显著缓解 CF。

Conclusion: AnaCP 证明了无需梯度训练即可实现特征的增量自适应和高效分析分类器的结合，为 CIL 提供了一种高效且有效的新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Browse the optimization challenges in training SAEs due to correlated inputs and to boost interpretability metrics.

Method: Apply PCA whitening to input activations; provide theoretical analysis showing landscape becomes more convex; evaluate ReLU and Top-K SAEs across various architectures, widths, and sparsity; use SAEBench for empirical evaluation measuring interpretability and reconstruction.

Result: Whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics (e.g., sparse probing accuracy, feature disentanglement) across models, with minor drops in reconstruction quality; optimization landscape becomes easier to navigate.

Conclusion: Whitening should be a default preprocessing step for SAE training when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction, challenging the assumption that best interpretability aligns with the sparsity–fidelity trade-off.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Node-level uncertainty estimation for LLM-generated SQL via AST-aware labeling and a feature-based classifier, yielding per-node error probabilities that outperform token-probabilities and enable targeted repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level confidence is inadequate for debugging complex SQL; precise, semantically grounded, per-node uncertainty enables targeted diagnosis, repair, and safer deployment across databases.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) semantically aware labeling that assigns per-node correctness with respect to a gold reference without over-penalizing structure or aliasing; (2) extract rich schema-aware and lexical features for each AST node (identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, scope ambiguity, typos) and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities; interpret these as calibrated uncertainty.

Result: Across multiple databases/datasets the method outperforms token log-probabilities, with average AUC improvement of 27.44% and robustness in cross-database evaluation.

Conclusion: Node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation is a strong, interpretable alternative to sequence-level confidence, enabling targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and selective execution.

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统地理解在受限领域内进行拒绝未学习时，模型为何会在无关任务上表现出有害行为，以及跨域传播的机制、数据与任务因素。

Method: 在两大模型家族（Mistral-7b-0.3v、Qwen-7b-2.5）上，对Cybersecurity与Safety概念执行窄域拒绝学习；评估七个RAI域（Cybersecurity、Safety、Toxicity、Bias、Sensitive Content、Medical/Legal、Privacy）的拒绝分数；在受影响域上用小规模保留数据配合交叉熵训练以观察对齐恢复情况；通过在表示层进行概念向量分析，考察早期层相似性与EMA的关系。

Result: 窄域拒绝学习能实现目标概念的合规化，但可能将EMA传播到无关域；Safety概念对其他域（如Bias）产生更显著的EMA下降（更低的拒绝分数）。两种模型均出现此现象；通过加入来自受影响域的小型保留数据并使用交叉熵训练，对齐在受影响域得到较大程度的恢复，同时对目标概念的拒绝率下降。通过分析概念向量，发现在前几层表示中与其他概念的高相似性使其更易在拒绝流被改变时产生EMA。

Conclusion: 域内拒绝未学习可能引发跨域的 emergent misalignment；利用有限的数据进行额外的交叉熵训练可缓解并部分恢复对齐。表示层的概念 entanglement 提供了潜在的机制解释，提示在设计治理策略时需考虑跨域影响与早期层表示的相似性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.

TL;DR: CFG-EC提出一种通用校正方案，针对CFG在采样阶段无条件噪声预测与条件噪声预测之间的耦合问题，通过让无条件噪声误差与条件误差正交化来降低采样误差上界，从而在低引导下显著提升性能并提高对提示的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Classifier-Free Guidance训练阶段，随机在条件提示与空提示之间切换；但在采样阶段同时输出空与条件提示，导致训练与采样过程的噪声估计不一致。需要一种通用且有效的校正机制，降低采样阶段的误差，提高生成保真度与对提示的对齐。

Conclusion: CFG-EC提供了一种通用的无条件噪声校正框架，通过约束采样阶段的误差上界，获得更稳定的引导轨迹和更高保真度的图像生成。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模 Mixture-of-Experts 推理在内存容量受限的设备上的数据移动成本与 I/O 瓶颈问题。现有专家下放会产生 PCIe 传输的严重阻塞，导致性能下降。需一种低开销、可预测的数据前瞻性策略来隐藏数据搬运成本。

Method: 提出 MoE-SpeQ，结合 speculative execution 与专家下放的共同设计。使用一小型 on-device draft 模型预测未来 token 需要的专家序列；运行时编排器据此从主机内存预取相应专家数据，从而与高成本 I/O 进行数据重叠，隐藏延迟。引入自适应 governor，在 Amortization Roofline Model 指引下动态调整推测策略以适配底层硬件。

Conclusion: 给出了一种以最小成本的设备端推测性计算来隐藏数据搬运成本的 principled 设计思路，证明了在资源有限的硬件上提升 MoE 推理可行性，为在通用硬件上部署大规模 MoE 提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

*Agamdeep Singh,Ashish Tiwari,Hosein Hasanbeig,Priyanshu Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Treat annotation distributions as ground truth; soft-label training preserves epistemic uncertainty and aligns model predictions with human judgments without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tasks involve subjective labeling; collapsing diverse labels into a single ground truth ignores uncertainty and can misalign model confidence with human perception.

Method: Train models using soft labels derived from annotator distributions (soft-label training) and evaluate on vision and NLP tasks. Compare against hard-label training in terms of KL divergence to human annotations, correlation between model entropy and annotation entropy, and overall accuracy.

Result: Soft-label training reduces KL divergence to human annotations by 32% and increases correlation between model and annotation entropy by 61%, while achieving similar accuracy to hard-label training.

Conclusion: Annotation distributions should be treated as faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty, and models should learn to reproduce these distributions rather than collapsing them to single labels.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Conclusion: 提出了一个基于约束GNE的公平性框架，用于大规模多智能体学习的医疗系统，提供可解释的公平性、均衡寻求机制，以及明确的评估指标和创新点。

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

Abstract: Phonocardiogram (PCG) analysis is vital for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled pathological data hinders the capability of AI systems. To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fréchet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3\%. H-LDM establishes a new direction for data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics, bridging data scarcity with interpretable clinical insights.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PAFM-03B2.

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

*Anthony Kiggundu,Bin Han,Hans D. Schotten*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 对双M/M/1排队系统中两种信息源（闭式马克洛夫估计与在线性-actor-critic）对弃置和抢占的影响进行对比分析。结论：总等待随 backlog 线性增长，拥堵极限时放弃必然，抢占成功概率趋于零；在一个温和的子线性误差条件下，两种信息源具有相同渐近界限，存在鲁棒性。有限 backlog 下信息源差异显著，但渐近一致，表明信息价值在有限规模才显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究信息源质量（解析性信息与学习性信息）对拥挤系统中的弃置与抢占行为的影响，比较两类信息模型在不同规模下的表现，以及在渐近极限下的鲁棒性，以指导低成本遥测与决策逻辑的设计。

Method: 理论分析：在双M/M/1 系统中考虑不等服务率和总时长耐心，推导两种信息源的影响；信息源包括闭式马克洛夫估计的残余逗留时间与在线训练的 actor-critic；在给定子线性误差条件下分析渐近行为；并通过经验性实验验证结果。

Result: 核心结果包括：1) 总等待随 backlog 线性增长，弃置成为必然；当 backlog 趋向无穷大时，抢占成功的概率趋于零。2) 在温和的子线性误差条件下，两信息源给出相同的渐近极限，表现出鲁棒性。3) 通过实验验证了理论极限，并量化有限 backlog 下的差异：学习性与解析性信息源在实际规模下对延迟、弃置率和瞬态抢占行为有差异，但最终收敛到相同的渐近结果。4) 指出何时信息价值显著（有限尺度）、何时不显著（渐近）。

Conclusion: 结论强调信息价值在有限规模才显著，而在渐近极限下两种信息源的行为趋同，具有鲁棒性。对低成本、具备抢占感知的系统设计提出指引：在有限 backlog 下选择信息源以优化性能；而在追求渐近稳定性时，简化信息源也可达到相同结果。

Abstract: We study how two information feeds, a closed-form Markov estimator of residual sojourn and an online trained actor-critic, affect reneging and jockeying in a dual M/M/1 system. Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness). We empirically validate these limits and quantify finite backlog differences. Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory. The results characterize when value-of-information matters (finite regimes) and when it does not (asymptotics), informing lightweight telemetry and decision-logic design for low-cost, jockeying-aware systems.

Motivation: 临床数据中生物标志物轨迹预测的不确定性高，可能导致误诊等高风险后果；需要在临床应用中提供安全、可靠的预测区间及覆盖保证，尤其是在不规则就诊时间条件下。

Conclusion: 该工作量化并保证在现实世界临床决策中对 biomarker trajectories 的不确定性进行校准，提升了预测在临床中的可用性与决策价值，且代码公开以便复现实验。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in predicting biomarker trajectories from real clinical data, uncertainty in the predictions poses high-stakes risks (e.g., misdiagnosis) that limit their clinical deployment. To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要对随机森林等集成方法进行统计推断，但现有方法多侧重预测性能而缺乏统一的似然/置信推断框架。利用EL可实现分布假设较弱的渐近性质，并可结合子采样/不完全U统计结构提升推断能力。

Method: 构建基于EL的统计量，利用集成预测中的不完全U统计结构；在子采样导致的不完整性下，EL统计量在子采样不太稀疏时呈现渐近卡方分布；针对稀疏子采样，提出简单的改进以恢复枢轴性；保持EL的核心性质且具备良好计算效率。

Result: 理论表明在“诚实随机森林”等设置下，改进后的EL可实现准确覆盖率；仿真验证相比现有推断方法具有更好的可靠性和实用性。

Conclusion: 为随机森林及相关集成方法提供一个可行、鲁棒且计算高效的统计推断框架，特别是在子采样导致的不完全性条件下，改进的EL仍然保持有效性与稳定性。

Abstract: We develop an empirical likelihood (EL) framework for random forests and related ensemble methods, providing a likelihood-based approach to quantify their statistical uncertainty. Exploiting the incomplete $U$-statistic structure inherent in ensemble predictions, we construct an EL statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared when subsampling induced by incompleteness is not overly sparse. Under sparser subsampling regimes, the EL statistic tends to over-cover due to loss of pivotality; we therefore propose a modified EL that restores pivotality through a simple adjustment. Our method retains key properties of EL while remaining computationally efficient. Theory for honest random forests and simulations demonstrate that modified EL achieves accurate coverage and practical reliability relative to existing inference methods.

Motivation: 需要一种高度表达力的局部基函数来适应不同尺度和方向，以提高对低维数据的近似、估计和逆问题求解的可解释性、灵活性和准确性；同时希望将现有的斑点化（splatting）方法统一在一个理论框架内，区分逆问题、模型与优化算法。

Method: 将输出建模为混合的异质且各向异性的斑点（bump functions，splats），每个斑点带有一个输出向量权重；通过优化混合测度空间来拟合模型，采用Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao梯度流来实现该优化；作为副产物，将高斯斑点法作为特例纳入统一框架。

Result: 数值实验表明，该模型与算法在低维数据的近似、估计和逆问题中具有良好灵活性与潜力；实现了高可解释性与准确性的权衡，并提供了一个统一理论框架来区分问题的各个组成部分（逆问题、模型、优化算法）。

Conclusion: Splat Regression Models构成一个灵活、可解释且强大的回归框架，适用于多样化的近似、估计和逆问题，特别是在低维数据场景中。未来工作可在提高可扩展性、对比基线、以及扩展应用领域方面展开。

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive class of function approximators called Splat Regression Models. Model outputs are mixtures of heterogeneous and anisotropic bump functions, termed splats, each weighted by an output vector. The power of splat modeling lies in its ability to locally adjust the scale and direction of each splat, achieving both high interpretability and accuracy. Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting models and algorithms constitute a flexible and promising approach for solving diverse approximation, estimation, and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data.

Motivation: 在样本不足或模型不确定性下，单独的协方差或精度矩阵估计容易产生谱偏差和病态问题，需要同时稳健地估计两者。

Method: 将最坏情形下的加权Frobenius损失与Stein损失组合，使用以谱散度为度量的模糊集合，将问题化为凸优化，从而得到准解析的非线性收缩估计器；特征值向一个正标量收缩，收缩强度由权重决定。

Conclusion: 通过谱聚焦收缩实现协方差与精度矩阵的联合稳健估计，提升估计稳定性和应用范围，提供可行的参数调优方案。

Abstract: We propose a distributionally robust formulation for simultaneously estimating the covariance matrix and the precision matrix of a random vector.The proposed model minimizes the worst-case weighted sum of the Frobenius loss of the covariance estimator and Stein's loss of the precision matrix estimator against all distributions from an ambiguity set centered at the nominal distribution. The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的袋装（bagging）聚合仅基于边的置信度来构造平均DAG，忽略边之间的高阶结构（如共现模式与子图结构），在数据稀缺和高维环境中可能导致不可靠的因果图。需要引入更丰富的高阶关系来提升聚合的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 提出一个以高阶结构为基础的理论框架，并给出新的DAG聚合算法，将引导的高阶关系（不仅限于单边置信度）融入到汇聚过程，结合自助法产生的多份DAG进行高阶模式的整合，以得到更稳定的共识DAG。

Conclusion: 高阶结构驱动的DAG聚合能提升因果图学习在数据稀缺与高维场景下的鲁棒性和准确性，提出的方法在计算上也具有优势，为因果发现的聚合步骤提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Causal discovery combines data with knowledge provided by experts to learn the DAG representing the causal relationships between a given set of variables. When data are scarce, bagging is used to measure our confidence in an average DAG obtained by aggregating bootstrapped DAGs. However, the aggregation step has received little attention from the specialized literature: the average DAG is constructed using only the confidence in the individual edges of the bootstrapped DAGs, thus disregarding complex higher-order edge structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework based on higher-order structures and describe a new DAG aggregation algorithm. We perform a simulation study, discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Our proposal is both computationally efficient and effective, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions, especially in low sample size regimes and under high dimensionality settings.

TL;DR: 提出 SkewD，一种在 location-scale noise models 下用于二变量因果发现的似然基算法，能在偏态噪声下有效区分因果方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果发现中，辨别 X→Y 与 Y→X 的因果方向需要对结构因果模型进行约束；LSNMs 提供灵活性和可辨识性，但对任意噪声分布的估计困难，偏态噪声在现实数据常见，现有方法在强偏态下鲁棒性下降。

Method: 将普通正态框架推广到偏态的对称-偏态分布（偏正态/skew-normal），采用启发式搜索结合期望条件最大化（ECM）算法进行参数估计。

Result: 在含偏态噪声的新合成数据集和基准数据集上，SkewD 展现出较强的性能，且在高偏度下对比先前工作更鲁棒。

Conclusion: SkewD 扩展了 LSNM 在偏态噪声下的因果发现能力，提供更可靠的方向推断，提升实际应用的可用性。

Abstract: To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \to Y$ and $Y \to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness.
