These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and\nrisk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit\nbased spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features\nwith a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and\nseasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with\nlearnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and\namplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive\ndistributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and\ncalibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real\nworld datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing\nagainst five state of the art baselines.

However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can\ndeliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent\nwithout substantially compromising the reasoning quality."}

However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels.

In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher\ncan improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the\nbest-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design\nchoices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when\ngenerating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size\nconstraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively\nidentify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide\nfine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation."}

Such systems\nprovide a canonical setting for multiscale modeling, where simple microscopic\ninteraction rules generate complex macroscopic behaviors. While our earlier\nwork established a Gaussian process approach and convergence theory for\nsingle-species systems, and later extended to second-order models with\nalignment and energy-type interactions, the multi-species setting introduces\nnew challenges: heterogeneous populations interact both within and across\nspecies, the number of unknown kernels grows, and asymmetric interactions such\nas predator-prey dynamics must be accommodated. We formulate the learning\nproblem in a nonparametric Bayesian setting and establish rigorous statistical\nguarantees. Our analysis shows recoverability of the interaction kernels,\nprovides quantitative error bounds, and proves statistical optimality of\nposterior estimators, thereby unifying and generalizing previous single-species\ntheory. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its\nadvantages over existing kernel-based methods. This work contributes a complete\nstatistical framework for data-driven inference of interaction laws in\nmulti-species systems, advancing the broader multiscale modeling program of\nconnecting microscopic particle dynamics with emergent macroscopic behavior."}

We also\nprovide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions.\nBeyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future\ntrajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment\ntime series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational\nforecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual\nqueries, and effectively detects anomalies.

Building on the seminal work\nof Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits\nof SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on\nthe critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the\neffective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical\nscale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this\nregime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the\neffective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain\nconditions. These results highlight how the information exponent controls\nsample complexity and illustrates the limitations of deterministic scaling\nlimit in capturing the stochastic fluctuations of high-dimensional learning\ndynamics."}

The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs\nsampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how\nto circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random\nfields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we\nintroduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting\nnew class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the\nnew model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of\ncomputational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling\nusing at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties\nclose to classical MRFs."}
