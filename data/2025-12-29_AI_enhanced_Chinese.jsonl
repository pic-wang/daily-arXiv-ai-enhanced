We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \\oplus S^{\\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data. In short, our work bridges the gap between abstract information geometry and the demand of explainable AI, by providing a tractable path for revealing the statistical coverage and the efficiency of non-parametric models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nevertheless, assessing data quality post-compression remains computationally expensive due to the intensive nature of metric calculations. In this work, we present a general-purpose deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction (DeepCQ), with the following key contributions: 1) We develop a surrogate model for compression quality prediction that is generalizable to different error-bounded lossy compressors, quality metrics, and input datasets; 2) We adopt a novel two-stage design that decouples the computationally expensive feature-extraction stage from the light-weight metrics prediction, enabling efficient training and modular inference; 3) We optimize the model performance on time-evolving data using a mixture-of-experts design. Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods.

As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \\texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps.

The new velocity inherits the regularity of stochastic interpolant transports while also being the minimizer of an objective with strictly lower variance than flow matching itself. The update to the velocity field can be interpreted as the sum of all joint cumulants of the stochastic interpolant and copies of the reward, and to first order is their covariance. The algorithms do not require any access to gradients of the reward or backpropagating through trajectories of the flow or diffusion. We empirically verify that the approach is efficient and highly scalable, providing state-of-the-art results on sampling under Lennard-Jones potentials and is competitive on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, without requiring reward multipliers.

The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure.

If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data.

Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments.

In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens.

The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training.

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise.

Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning.

However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries.

Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks.

Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks.

Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \\(\\pm\\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization.

In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance.

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors.

Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa.

High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization.

Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation.

We give a concrete counterexample demonstrating the failure of classical stability bounds and identify a minimal generalized derivative condition under which stability statements can be meaningfully restored. The result clarifies why smooth approximations of ReLU can be misleading and motivates nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conference workshop paper", "summary": "Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a strong and widely used first-order adversarial attack, yet its computational cost scales poorly, as all training samples undergo identical iterative inner-loop optimization despite contributing unequally to robustness. Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \\emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each minibatch. Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed methods achieve robustness comparable to, or even exceeding, full PGD adversarial training, while reducing adversarial computation by up to $50\\%$, demonstrating that informed sample selection is sufficient for scalable adversarial robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $\u0398(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.
