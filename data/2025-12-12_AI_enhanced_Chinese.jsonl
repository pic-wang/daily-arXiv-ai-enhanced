However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 HGC-Herd\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 HGNN \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 GCond\uff09\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u591a\u8df3\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684 per-class herding \u7b56\u7565\u9009\u53d6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u8282\u70b9\uff1b3) \u6784\u9020\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u5177\u8fa8\u522b\u529b\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ACM\u3001DBLP\u3001Freebase \u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHGC-Herd \u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u4e0e\u5168\u56fe\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0cHGC-Herd \u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships.

In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively.

Figueiredo"], "title": "LxCIM: a new rank-based binary classifier performance metric invariant to local exchange of classes", "comment": "28 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Binary classification is one of the oldest, most prevalent, and studied problems in machine learning. However, the metrics used to evaluate model performance have received comparatively little attention. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) has long been a standard choice for model comparison. Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC. Finally, we demonstrate the direct applicability of LxCIM to the bivariate causal discovery problem (which exhibits invariance to local exchange of classes) and show how it addresses the acknowledged limitations of existing metrics used in this field.

We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\u03ba=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.", "AI": {"tldr": "HB-SGE \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 heavy-ball \u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6cf0\u52d2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u975e\u51f8/\u75c5\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 heavy-ball \u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6cf0\u52d2\u903c\u8fd1\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u4ec5\u9700 O(d) \u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4e8c\u6b21\u95ee\u9898 \u03ba=50 \u65f6\uff0cHB-SGE \u6536\u655b\u5728 119 \u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cSGD \u4e0e NAG \u53d1\u6563\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u51f8 Rosenbrock \u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u5728 2718 \u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u91cf\u5728 10 \u6b65\u5185\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "conclusion": "HB-SGE \u4e3a\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u6837\u5730\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e SGD \u6709\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b NAG \u4ecd\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u540c\u3002"}}

Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task.

It is designed to model complex, uncertain systems whose random outputs are strongly non-Gaussian given deterministic inputs. The architecture itself is a random object stochastically generated by a latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defined on a compact, boundaryless, multiply-connected manifold. The goal is to establish a novel conceptual and mathematical framework in which neural architectures are realizations of a geometry-aware, field-driven generative process. Both the neural topology and synaptic weights emerge jointly from a latent random field. A reduced-order parameterization governs the spatial intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the manifold, from which neuron locations are sampled. Input and output neurons are identified via extremal evaluations of the latent field, while connectivity is established through geodesic proximity and local field affinity. Synaptic weights are conditionally sampled from the field realization, inducing stochastic output responses even for deterministic inputs. To ensure scalability, the architecture is sparsified via percentile-based diffusion masking, yielding geometry-aware sparse connectivity without ad hoc structural assumptions. Supervised learning is formulated as inference on the generative hyperparameters of the latent field, using a negative log-likelihood loss estimated through Monte Carlo sampling from single-observation-per-input datasets. The paper initiates a mathematical analysis of the model, establishing foundational properties such as well-posedness, measurability, and a preliminary analysis of the expressive variability of the induced stochastic mappings, which support its internal coherence and lay the groundwork for a broader theory of geometry-driven stochastic learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details.

The field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to design methods that generalize better to test environments whose distributions differ from those observed during training. One line of such works has proposed to minimize the maximum risk across environments, a principle that we refer to as MaxRM (Maximum Risk Minimization). In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method.

This approach improves the physical interpretability of surrogate models while achieving high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$. The proposed methods are integrated into the PC$^2$ framework and evaluated through numerical examples of representative physical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations.

Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees.

Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined.

Under review for IEEE TPAMI", "summary": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences.

We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.\n  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution.

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems.\n  We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.\n  Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.\n  Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties.

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences.

Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \\textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget.

Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528 Top-K \u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u9884\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u70b9\u79ef\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u7684 perplexity \u4e0e\u96f6-shot \u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b KV \u7f13\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d L1 \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 Top-K \u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u539f\u5b50\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0 Key \u5411\u91cf\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u53d7\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u8098\u90e8\u2019\u652f\u914d\uff1bValue \u5411\u91cf\u643a\u5e26\u5bc6\u96c6\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Dual-Budget \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u91cf\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Yi-6B\u3001Mistral-7B\u3001Qwen2.5-32B \u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96f6-shot \u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u628a KV \u7f13\u5b58\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLaT-IB\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5e72\u51c0(MSC)\u51c6\u5219\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u8fdb\u884c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0e\u6e05\u6d01\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MSC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6e05\u6d01\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u89e3\u8026\u7b49\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4f7f\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u6e05\u6d01/\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6696\u8eab\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cLaT-IB\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7MSC-\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u53ca\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings.

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution.

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.\n  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process.

While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization.

Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation.

Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity.

To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set.

We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets.

Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings.
