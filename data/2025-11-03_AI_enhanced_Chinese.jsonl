Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction.

To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios.

In particular, we develop a\nthree-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,\nand show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks\nand that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct\nexpert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts\nand makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the\nexpected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration\nsteps, significantly improving over the $O(\\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single\ntransformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive\nreal-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.\nTogether, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of\ntransformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical\nguidance for designing efficient large-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al.

Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets.

Spatial\nnormalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,\nbut often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when\nlocalization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted\nbrain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between\nindividuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)\nlearns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from\nmulti-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive\nobjectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to\nregion-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a\ntransformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of\nchannels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal\nganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording\nsessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space\nsupports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,\nregion-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The\ntransformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or\nsupervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of\nmasked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.\nTogether, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject\naggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task\nstructure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling.

By\njointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates\ncontrollable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative\ndynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties\nserve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting\nentangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce\npredictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nand CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through\nvon-Neumann entanglement entropy.

However, offline\npolicy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally\namplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might\nbenefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about\nfairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a\ngroup-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing\ngroup-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle\nthe following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained\nwithin some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized\nduring policy optimization.

To address these challenges, we propose\nBayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with\nno need for attack simulation.

Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized\nBayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.\nComprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which\nsignificantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the\ncompatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The\nimprovements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\\ell_1$-norm error\nof our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,\nbut importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent\nsampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter\ntuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.\nWe also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for\nanalyzing the $\\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of\nnon-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret.

By collapsing a feature's\nrole into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and\ninteractions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis\n(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned\nfunction. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying\nits: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.\nCrucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which\ntracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This\ntemporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it\nlearns.

That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW.

Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence.

However, applying RAG to finance\nencounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,\nlimited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data\ninterpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored\nfor Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt\nengineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval\nstrategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while\nmaintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic\nprompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision\nand contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,\nwe propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,\ninterpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal\nreasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and\noptimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process.

To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a\ngraph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in\nformulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs.

We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
