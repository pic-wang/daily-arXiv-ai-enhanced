Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness). We empirically validate these limits and quantify finite backlog differences. Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory. The results characterize when value-of-information matters (finite regimes) and when it does not (asymptotics), informing lightweight telemetry and decision-logic design for low-cost, jockeying-aware systems."}

To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making.

Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets.

However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification.

In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/α)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/α^2$.

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds."}

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting."}

ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs.

Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks.

Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set.

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity."}

We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions.

RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning.

Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming."}

Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations.

Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses.

Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance.

Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan.

The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates.

Learning on Graphs Conference 2025", "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective."}

First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution.

In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/α)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/α^2$.

However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods."}

Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning."}

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds."}

Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score.

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates.

To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation.

However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy."}

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware."}

Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data."}

Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement.

We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion.

Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR."}

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings."}

These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems.

This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS."}

FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU.

In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification.

Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements.

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization.

First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation.

Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods.

Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection.

CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data.

Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets.
