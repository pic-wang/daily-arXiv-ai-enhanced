We take an indirect approach to this question: rather than analyzing the model architecture or training dynamics, we ask why a pretrained Bayes estimator, trained under a prespecified training distribution, can adapt to arbitrary test distributions. Focusing on Poisson EB problems, we identify the existence of universal priors such that training under these priors yields a near-optimal regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{1}{n})$ uniformly over all test distributions. Our analysis leverages the classical phenomenon of posterior contraction in Bayesian statistics, showing that the pretrained transformer adapts to unknown test distributions precisely through posterior contraction. This perspective also explains the phenomenon of length generalization, in which the test sequence length exceeds the training length, as the model performs Bayesian inference using a generalized posterior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4f2a\u9020\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9 Poisson \u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u666e\u904d\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 Bayes \u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5 Poisson \u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u666e\u904d\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7684 regret \u4e0a\u754c\uff08~O(1/n)\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u7406\u8bba\u8bf4\u660e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7684 regret \u4e0a\u754c ~O(1/n)\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6536\u7f29\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6536\u655b\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 Bayes \u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

One of the major frameworks is the order-based approach that first estimates a topological order of the underlying DAG and then prunes spurious edges from the fully-connected DAG induced by the estimated topological order. Previous studies often focus on the former ordering step because it can dramatically reduce the search space of DAGs. In practice, the latter pruning step is equally crucial for ensuring both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. Most existing methods employ a pruning technique based on generalized additive models and hypothesis testing, commonly known as CAM-pruning. However, this approach can be a computational bottleneck as it requires repeatedly fitting additive models for all variables. Furthermore, it may harm estimation quality due to multiple testing. To address these issues, we introduce a new pruning method based on sparse additive models, which enables direct pruning of redundant edges without relying on hypothesis testing. We propose an efficient algorithm for learning sparse additive models by combining the randomized tree embedding technique with group-wise sparse regression. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance.

We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{SAH^3}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs.

While existing approaches focus primarily on learning simulations from the target PDE, they often overlook more fundamental physical principles underlying these equations. Inspired by how numerical solvers are compatible with simulations of different settings of PDEs, we propose a multiphysics training framework that jointly learns from both the original PDEs and their simplified basic forms. Our framework enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors, and improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in scenarios involving shifts of physical parameters and synthetic-to-real transfer. Our method is architecture-agnostic and demonstrates consistent improvements in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) across a wide range of 1D/2D/3D PDE problems.

To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models.

We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget.

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions.

(2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts.

Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations. The inferred reward uncertainty further provides interpretable signals for analyzing model confidence and consistency across feedback types.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we investigate an alternative approach based on adaptive per-instance noise calibration tailored to the individual contribution of each data point to the learned solution. This raises the following challenge: how can one establish formal unlearning guarantees when the mechanism depends on the specific point to be removed? To define individual data point sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics, we consider the use of per-instance differential privacy. For ridge regression trained via Langevin dynamics, we derive high-probability per-instance sensitivity bounds, yielding certified unlearning with substantially less noise injection.

A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the \"curse of multilinguality\". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs. These results show that targeted, per-language data curation mitigates multilingual interference and enables compute-efficient multilingual scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present the first systematic study of scaling behaviour for masked-reconstruction transformers trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using expression profiles from the CELLxGENE Census, we construct two experimental regimes: a data-rich regime (512 highly variable genes, 200,000 cells) and a data-limited regime (1,024 genes, 10,000 cells). Across seven model sizes spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count (533 to 3.4 x 10^8 parameters), we fit the parametric scaling law to validation mean squared error (MSE). The data-rich regime exhibits clear power-law scaling with an irreducible loss floor of c ~ 1.44, while the data-limited regime shows negligible scaling, indicating that model capacity is not the binding constraint when data are scarce. These results establish that scaling laws analogous to those observed in natural language processing do emerge in single-cell transcriptomics when sufficient data are available, and they identify the data-to-parameter ratio as a critical determinant of scaling behaviour. A preliminary conversion of the data-rich asymptotic floor to information-theoretic units yields an estimate of approximately 2.30 bits of entropy per masked gene position.

However, OPD requires expensive on-the-fly sampling of the student policy during training, which substantially increases training cost, especially for long responses. Our initial analysis shows that, during OPD, training signals are often concentrated in the prefix of each output, and that even a short teacher-generated prefix can significantly help the student produce the correct answer. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective modification of OPD: we apply the distillation objective only to prefixes of student-generated outputs and terminate each sampling early during distillation.

We propose a quantum-inspired classification head architecture that projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space and evolves them under a learned unitary transformation parameterised via the Cayley map. Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510). Surprisingly, replacing the softmax readout with a Born rule measurement layer - the quantum-mechanically motivated approach - degrades calibration to an ECE of 0.0819. On the CIFAR-10H human-uncertainty benchmark, the wave function head achieves the lowest KL-divergence (0.336) to human soft labels among all compared methods, indicating that complex-valued representations better capture the structure of human perceptual ambiguity.

We present a hybrid privacy-preserving framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) to support decision-oriented healthcare modeling without raw-data sharing. The approach keeps feature-extraction trunks on clients while hosting prediction heads on a coordinating server, enabling shared representation learning and exposing an explicit collaboration boundary where privacy controls can be applied. Rather than assuming distributed training is inherently private, we audit leakage empirically using membership inference on cut-layer representations and study lightweight defenses based on activation clipping and additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate across three public clinical datasets under non-IID client partitions using a unified pipeline and assess performance jointly along four deployment-relevant axes: factual predictive utility, uplift-based ranking under capacity constraints, audited privacy leakage, and communication overhead. Results show that hybrid FL-SL variants achieve competitive predictive performance and decision-facing prioritization behavior relative to standalone FL or SL, while providing a tunable privacy-utility trade-off that can reduce audited leakage without requiring raw-data sharing. Overall, the work positions hybrid FL-SL as a practical design space for privacy-preserving healthcare decision support where utility, leakage risk, and deployment cost must be balanced explicitly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces a curvature-dependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead.

Existing resampling and reweighting strategies often disrupt inter-label dependencies or require brittle hyperparameter tuning, especially as the label space expands to tens of thousands of labels. To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor (\"player\") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement. This mechanism adaptively injects learning signals into under-represented tail labels without manual balancing or tuning. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that our CD-GTMLL converges to a tail-aware equilibrium and formally links the optimization dynamics to improvements in the Rare-F1 metric. Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of both game-theoretic cooperation and curiosity-driven exploration to robust tail performance. By integrating game theory with curiosity mechanisms, CD-GTMLL not only enhances model efficiency in resource-constrained environments but also paves the way for more adaptive learning in imbalanced data scenarios across industries like e-commerce and healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21).

By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\\% over the current state-of-the-art method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors.

Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<\u03b1\\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose a general, domain-agnostic framework that integrates two interacting diffusion models: one operating on the input signal and the other on the classifier's output logits, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning of the classifier. This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold. We introduce three strategies to effectively model the joint distribution of the input and the logit.

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization.

Therefore, a number of methods varying in the tightness of their bounds and their computational cost have been developed to approximate the Lipschitz constant for different classes of networks. However, comparatively little research exists on methods for exact computation, which has been shown to be NP-hard. Nonetheless, there are applications where one might readily accept the computational cost of an exact method. These applications could include the benchmarking of new methods or the computation of robustness guarantees for small models on sensitive data.

In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria.

Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing.

While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \\emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \\emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments.

Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \\emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks.

The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings.

In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order.

To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models. Finally, the proposed model confirms the robustness and applicability of the proposed method by providing interpretability at various stages of disease diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form \"sequences of regions\" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness.

However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck.\n  In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We address this challenge by proposing a TTA framework based on storing maximally informative (D-optimal) statistics, which jointly enables stable adaptation and principled parameter selection at test time. When applied to pretrained simulation surrogates, our method yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvements at negligible computational cost.

We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices.

The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude.
