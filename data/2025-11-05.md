### [1] [DeepContour: A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Accelerating Generalized Eigenvalue Problem Solving via Efficient Contour Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01927)
*Yeqiu Chen,Ziyan Liu,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepContour 将 FNO 预测光谱与 KDE 结合，用于对 GEP 的轮廓选择进行 principled 设计，在 CI 求解中实现加速，最高达 5.63x。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CI 方法对积分轮廓的选择高度敏感，若缺乏先验的特征分布信息，会导致计算成本上升和精度下降。需要一种能够在保有数值鲁棒性的前提下自动化、系统地设计轮廓的方法。

Method: 先用 Fourier Neural Operator 预测广义特征值问题的谱分布；再用 Kernel Density Estimation 基于预测的谱估计轮廓，得到合适的积分轮廓；最后在 CI 求解器中使用这些轮廓求解特征值。

Result: 在多组数据集上，DeepContour 将 GEP 求解加速，最高达到 5.63 倍速度提升；在保证数值精度的同时实现鲁棒性与高效性。

Conclusion: 将深度学习谱预测与经典求解器相结合，提出一种高效且鲁棒的框架，适用于高维大规模 GEP 的轮廓设计和求解，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

### [6] [The Eigenvalues Entropy as a Classifier Evaluation Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01904)

TL;DR: 本研究提出利用特征值熵作为分类器评估指标，适用于二分类与多分类；通过与灵敏度、特异度、ROC-AUC、基尼系数等相关性建立映射，并能在一定程度上估计混淆矩阵以应对类别不平衡，实验显示优于传统评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在类别不平衡场景下，常用评估指标（如准确率等）往往失真。本研究提出以特征值熵为核心的评估量，旨在提供对分类器整体性能的稳健度量，并具备对混淆矩阵的推断能力。

Method: 计算基于混淆矩阵或相关线性算子的特征值分布所产生的特征值熵，并在二分类情形下建立特征值与灵敏度、特异度、ROC曲线下面积与Gini指数之间的关系；由特征值熵推导出对不平衡数据有利的混淆矩阵估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上，所提特征值熵评估在与黄金标准指标的对比中表现出更好的鲁棒性，尤其在类别不平衡情形下。

Conclusion: 特征值熵是一种对于二分类及多分类在存在类别不平衡时有用的评估度量，可提供对混淆矩阵的近似估计，并改善对分类器性能的评估。

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this
work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep
learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to
control and enhance model behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Abstract: Probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts offer a differentiable alternative to
spectral clustering, enabling end-to-end and online learning without
eigendecompositions, yet prior work centered on RatioCut and lacked general

framework that covers a wide class of cuts, including Normalized Cut. Our
framework provides tight analytic upper bounds on expected discrete cuts via
integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions with closed-form
forward and backward. Together, these results deliver a rigorous, numerically
stable foundation for scalable, differentiable graph partitioning covering a
wide range of clustering and contrastive learning objectives.

TL;DR: 提出 Tool-Zero 系列，在纯 RL 框架下通过动态通用化引导的奖励设计，训练模型自行使用通用工具，显著提升工具使用情境下的泛化与推理能力，相较 SFT 与 RL+SFT 提升约7%，并在跨数据集与单数据集上均展现稳健性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有监督微调在构建域内数据集后，往往难以泛化到陌生或复杂的工具使用场景；纯强化学习具有挖掘模型内在推理能力、提高对新工具泛化的潜力，但需设计适合的奖励机制以引导工具使用。

Method: 提出基于动态通用化的奖励设计用于基于规则的强化学习（rule-based RL），奖励从探索性工具使用逐步转向开发利用性工具使用的模式，并以从零模型开始（无后训练）扩展的方式训练 Tool-Zero 系列模型，使 LLM 能自主使用通用工具。

Result: 实验表明 Tool-Zero 在相同设置下比 SFT 与 RL-with-SFT 提升约7%，且结果在跨数据集与单数据集评估中均具备鲁棒性，支持该方法的有效性与稳健性。

Conclusion: 纯 RL 配合动态奖励设计能够唤起模型的内在推理能力并提升对通用工具的泛化能力，Tool-Zero 系列证明了从零模型出发的强化学习在工具自助使用方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中因学习新任务而遗忘旧任务的问题，探讨通过NTK可塑性边界、统计验证与路径质量指标来提升学习能力及稳态性。

Method: 提出路径协同框架，将NTK理论的可塑性边界、Wilson置信区间的统计验证以及多指标的路径质量评估结合起来；在Split-CIFAR-10上进行实验，评估多路径发现的比例及统计保证，分析NTK条件数对学习容量的预测性。

Conclusion: 框架有效缓解灾难性遗忘，表现具有竞争力，并揭示NTK条件数对容量的预测性，提供提升自适应正则化的实操性建议。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Motivation: 注意力变体日益增多，现有实现要么需要定制内核，要么依赖静态模板，难以在多样化模式下高效运行。需要一个能在 PyTorch 生态内自动生成高效内核的通用方法。

Method: Flashlight 作为编译器原生框架，嵌入 PyTorch 的编译流程，自动融合和分块注意力计算，且无需静态模板或特定内核。它支持 FlexAttention 的所有变体，以及更广泛、数据相关的注意力形式。

Result: 与 FlexAttention 相比，生成的内核具有竞争性甚至更优的性能，同时保留原生 PyTorch 代码的灵活性，便于快速探索新模型。

Conclusion: Flashlight 提供了一个灵活且高效的解决方案，在 PyTorch 生态中实现对多种注意力变体的高效支撑，超越了 FlexAttention 的局限性。

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Result: 在Voisard等人(2025)的多队列步态数据集的PD、OA、CVA筛查以及PD vs CVA分诊等四项任务上，注意力机制定量发现严重的数据集偏倚：在OA筛查和CVA筛查等需要双侧评估的任务中，模型对右脚的注意力超过70%，而对左脚几乎忽略（<0.1%）。这反映了数据集的 laterality bias，而非临床发现。作为次要发现，模型提出了头部+足部等新的传感器协同，供未来优化协议参考。

Conclusion: 该工作在方法学上提供了一个可解释框架，用于自动审计数据完整性，并提出数据驱动的传感器组合以优化未来的步态分析协议。

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

Method: 提出一个基于分布估计的算法来估计实例的最优目标值。训练过程使用一个不等式导出的损失函数，该损失函数为最优性条件的总偏差的期望，而不是直接使用目标函数值。该框架不计算策略的值，也不依赖于已求解的实例作为训练样本。

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

TL;DR: Online learning with uncertainty-guided ensemble improves prediction of Toroidal Field coil deflection under non-stationary fusion data; DGPA enables calibrated uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fusion data exhibits non-stationarity due to experimental evolution and component wear, causing distribution drift. Static ML models lose performance; online learning is needed for continuous adaptation.

Method: Apply online learning to drifting data streams; propose an uncertainty-guided online ensemble using Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) for calibrated uncertainty; ensemble combines learners trained on different historical horizons; DGPA provides uncertainty alongside predictions to guide the meta-algorithm.

Result: Online learning reduces prediction error by ~80% compared with a static model. An online ensemble yields ~6% additional reduction over standard single-model online learning; the uncertainty-guided online ensemble yields ~10% reduction relative to single-model online learning. DGPA provides calibrated uncertainty for decision makers.

Conclusion: Online learning is essential for maintaining ML performance on non-stationary fusion data. The proposed uncertainty-guided online ensemble improves robustness and decision support by leveraging horizon-diverse learners and calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables
synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket
time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping
dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we
propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that
preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine
learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this
human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms
latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines
into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing
pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the

calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and

machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced

we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process framework for learning interaction kernels in
multi-species interacting particle systems from trajectory data. Such systems
provide a canonical setting for multiscale modeling, where simple microscopic
interaction rules generate complex macroscopic behaviors. While our earlier
work established a Gaussian process approach and convergence theory for
single-species systems, and later extended to second-order models with
alignment and energy-type interactions, the multi-species setting introduces
new challenges: heterogeneous populations interact both within and across
species, the number of unknown kernels grows, and asymmetric interactions such
as predator-prey dynamics must be accommodated. We formulate the learning
problem in a nonparametric Bayesian setting and establish rigorous statistical
guarantees. Our analysis shows recoverability of the interaction kernels,
provides quantitative error bounds, and proves statistical optimality of
posterior estimators, thereby unifying and generalizing previous single-species
theory. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its
advantages over existing kernel-based methods. This work contributes a complete
statistical framework for data-driven inference of interaction laws in
multi-species systems, advancing the broader multiscale modeling program of
connecting microscopic particle dynamics with emergent macroscopic behavior.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting increasingly demands not only accurate observational

model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and
interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural

provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions.
Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future

datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment
time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational
forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual
queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the

quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Building on recent advances in optimizing such
discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of
kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of
size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to
general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples
from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional
setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known
density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore
the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its
$L_\infty$ counterpart.

Abstract: This paper studies the high-dimensional scaling limits of online stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) for single-layer networks. Building on the seminal work
of Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits
of SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on
the critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the
effective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical
scale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this
regime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the
effective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain
conditions. These results highlight how the information exponent controls
sample complexity and illustrates the limitations of deterministic scaling
limit in capturing the stochastic fluctuations of high-dimensional learning
dynamics.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of efficient sampling of Markov random fields
(MRF). The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs
sampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how
to circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random
fields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we
introduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting
new class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the
new model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of
computational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling
using at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties
close to classical MRFs.

Abstract: Concept drift and label scarcity are two critical challenges limiting the
robustness of predictive models in dynamic industrial environments. Existing
drift detection methods often assume global shifts and rely on dense
supervision, making them ill-suited for regression tasks with local drifts and
limited labels. This paper proposes an adaptive sampling framework that
combines residual-based exploration and exploitation with EWMA monitoring to
efficiently detect local concept drift under labeling budget constraints.
Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and a case study on electricity
market demonstrate superior performance in label efficiency and drift detection
accuracy.
