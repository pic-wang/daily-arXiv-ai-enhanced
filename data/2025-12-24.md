### [1] [Robust Causal Directionality Inference in Quantum Inference under MNAR Observation and High-Dimensional Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19746)
*Joonsung Kang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一个MNAR稳健的CVAE+GEE+AIPW+PEL框架，用于量子工程中的因果方向推断（系统→观测、观测→系统或双向）。在理论上具备双鲁棒性、扰动稳定性和Oracle不等式等保证，且在模拟及真实数据（TCGA转录组、蛋白质组学）上实现较低偏差/方差、近标称覆盖率和优越的量子特异性诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子力学中，观测过程会主动影响系统，类似缺失数据中的MNAR现象。现有因果方向推断在量子噪声与经典噪声共存的情景下易受偏差影响，因此需要一个在MNAR与量子噪声下都鲁棒的统一框架来确定因果方向。

Method: 将CVAE用于潜在约束，引入MNAR感知选择模型；使用GEE稳健回归以处理相关性与重复测量；结合惩罚性经验似然和贝叶斯优化实现参数学习与超参数调优；同时整合AIPW实现因果效应估计，最终得到MNAR-稳健的CVAE+GEE+AIPW+PEL框架，理论层面给出双鲁棒性、扰动稳定性与Oracle不等式等保证。

Result: 在仿真与真实数据分析（TCGA基因表达、蛋白质组学数据）中，该框架实现偏差和方差降低、覆盖率接近名义水平，并具备更好的量子特定诊断能力，显示出在鲁棒因果方向推断中的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法将鲁棒的因果方向推断作为可靠量子工程的关键方法论进步，具有潜在的广泛应用前景，尽管需要在不同量子系统与更大规模数据上进一步验证其普适性与计算成本等。

Abstract: In quantum mechanics, observation actively shapes the system, paralleling the statistical notion of Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This study introduces a unified framework for \textbf{robust causal directionality inference} in quantum engineering, determining whether relations are system$\to$observation, observation$\to$system, or bidirectional.
  The method integrates CVAE-based latent constraints, MNAR-aware selection models, GEE-stabilized regression, penalized empirical likelihood, and Bayesian optimization. It jointly addresses quantum and classical noise while uncovering causal directionality, with theoretical guarantees for double robustness, perturbation stability, and oracle inequalities.
  Simulation and real-data analyses (TCGA gene expression, proteomics) show that the proposed MNAR-stabilized CVAE+GEE+AIPW+PEL framework achieves lower bias and variance, near-nominal coverage, and superior quantum-specific diagnostics. This establishes robust causal directionality inference as a key methodological advance for reliable quantum engineering.

### [2] [Quasiprobabilistic Density Ratio Estimation with a Reverse Engineered Classification Loss Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19913)
*Matthew Drnevich,Stephen Jiggins,Kyle Cranmer*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种用于准概率密度比估计的凸损失函数，并扩展切片 Wasserstein 距离以兼容准概率分布，解决与最优分类器之间的映射不连续或不可满射的问题，在粒子物理场景（ggF 产生的 di-Higgs + jets）上达到状态-of-the-art。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分类器的密度比估计在准概率密度（可能为负值）场景下会产生不稳定性：损失函数隐含的分类器与目标密度比之间的映射可能不连续或不可满射；需要一个在概率与准概率设定下都良好定义的损失，以及一个与准概率兼容的距离度量。

Method: 提出一个凸损失函数，使得最优分类器与准概率密度比之间的关系保持良好（连续且可满射），并引入一个扩展的切片 Wasserstein 距离，能够处理准概率分布；在真实数据场景中将该框架应用于 di-Higgs 产生伴随喷射（ggF）等粒子物理问题进行评估。

Result: 在所述粒子物理任务上实现了最先进的结果，显示该凸损失与准概率 Wasserstein 距离的组合能显著提升密度比估计的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的凸损失以及与准概率兼容的切片 Wasserstein 距离为准概率密度比估计提供了一个稳健的框架，扩展了分类器基方法的适用性，并能有效地应用于具有负密度的实际场景，如粒子物理中的 ggF 过程等。

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the classifier-based density-ratio estimation task to a quasiprobabilistic setting where probability densities can be negative. The problem with most loss functions used for this task is that they implicitly define a relationship between the optimal classifier and the target quasiprobabilistic density ratio which is discontinuous or not surjective. We address these problems by introducing a convex loss function that is well-suited for both probabilistic and quasiprobabilistic density ratio estimation. To quantify performance, an extended version of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced which is compatible with quasiprobability distributions. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world example from particle physics, of di-Higgs production in association with jets via gluon-gluon fusion, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests are fundamental for assessing model adequacy. Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives.

### [4] [Generative Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20051)
*Hedibert Lopes,Nick Polson,Vadim Sokolov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种面向超参数调优的生成式框架，结合加权贝叶斯自举与仿射/传输映射的摊销优化，以实现对超参数的快速评估和近似贝叶斯不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模机器学习中的超参数选择成本问题；传统交叉验证代价高，完全贝叶斯超参数学习的后验采样成本高。

Method: 将随机加权的优化目标（加权贝叶斯自举）与从超参数到对应优化器的传输映射摊销重复优化过程，构造一个“生成器查找表”来快速评估不同超参数，并支持预测性调优目标与近似贝叶斯不确定性量化；并将该视角与加权M估计、 envelope/辅助变量表示以及用于加权M估计的生成采样方法联系起来。

Result: 实现一个可快速在超参数网格或连续区间上进行评估的生成器式工具，提供近似贝叶斯不确定性量化，并降低重复优化成本；在理论上与加权M估计及相关生成采样方法建立联系。

Conclusion: 给出一种新的超参数调优生成视角，具备可扩展性和不确定性量化能力，可将非二次损失转化为加权最小二乘等形式，并与现有方法形成连接。

Abstract: \noindent Hyper-parameter selection is a central practical problem in modern machine learning, governing regularization strength, model capacity, and robustness choices. Cross-validation is often computationally prohibitive at scale, while fully Bayesian hyper-parameter learning can be difficult due to the cost of posterior sampling. We develop a generative perspective on hyper-parameter tuning that combines two ideas: (i) optimization-based approximations to Bayesian posteriors via randomized, weighted objectives (weighted Bayesian bootstrap), and (ii) amortization of repeated optimization across many hyper-parameter settings by learning a transport map from hyper-parameters (including random weights) to the corresponding optimizer. This yields a ``generator look-up table'' for estimators, enabling rapid evaluation over grids or continuous ranges of hyper-parameters and supporting both predictive tuning objectives and approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We connect this viewpoint to weighted $M$-estimation, envelope/auxiliary-variable representations that reduce non-quadratic losses to weighted least squares, and recent generative samplers for weighted $M$-estimators.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Survival analysis relies fundamentally on the semi-parametric Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model and the parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time. Empirical results on multiple datasets confirm that KAN-AFT achieves performance comparable to or better than DeepAFT, while uniquely providing transparent, symbolic models of the survival process.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is complicated by the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.
  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \emph{without} incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a low-degree spherical polynomial of degree $\ell_0 = Θ(1) \ge 1$ defined on the unit sphere in $\RR^d$ by training an over-parameterized two-layer neural network (NN) with channel attention in this paper. Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\eps \in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \ge Θ({n^4 \log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \asymp Θ(d^{\ell_0}/\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\pth{d^{\ell_0} \max\set{\eps^{-2},\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\ell_0$ from the initial $L \ge \ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets. In Stage 2, the second layer is trained by standard GD using the activation function with the selected channels.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain.

*Taoran Sheng,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在可穿戴传感器的人体活动识别中，系统地比较了从完全监督到弱监督/自监督等全谱学习策略，发现弱监督及弱自监督方法在显著减少标注数据量的情况下能够达到接近甚至等同于全监督的性能，且多任务学习与领域知识嵌入有助于进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明不同学习范式具有互补优势，提供在标注数据有限情境下定制HAR解决方案的洞见；新提出的弱自监督框架对实际应用具有较大潜力。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction. Our experimental setup and source code are available at https://github.com/kuiumdjiev/Per-Axis-Weight-Deltas-for-Frequent-Model-Updates.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Okita-Laboratory/jointOptimizationFlowMatching.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeRAlab/ArcGen.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been an active area of research, with applications ranging from healthcare to smart environments. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities to leverage their capabilities in HAR, enabling not just activity classification but also interpretability and human-like interaction. In this paper, we present a Large Multi-Modal Agent designed for HAR, which integrates the power of LLMs to enhance both performance and user engagement. The proposed framework not only delivers activity classification but also bridges the gap between technical outputs and user-friendly insights through its reasoning and question-answering capabilities. We conduct extensive evaluations using widely adopted HAR datasets, including HHAR, Shoaib, Motionsense to assess the performance of our framework. The results demonstrate that our model achieves high classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving interpretability through its reasoning and Q&A capabilities.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

A first-ever pillar-based scoring formulation is derived via Principal Component Analysis, identifying Reproductive Efficiency, Genetic Management, Herd Health, and Herd Management, to construct weighted composite indices. These indices are modelled using a novel STGNN architecture that explicitly encodes geographic dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics to generate multi-year forecasts for 2026-2030.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention 是一个紧凑、可解释、物理可信的地球系统预测与生成建模的基础模块，有望成为下一代模型的核心组件。

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

Abstract: Recurrent off-policy deep reinforcement learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often sidelined due to their high computational demands.

When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark. We analyze various implementation strategies to highlight the versatility and potential of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.
