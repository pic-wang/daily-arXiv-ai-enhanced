As a promising\ndirection, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an\nefficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is\ncritically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper\nselection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur\nsignificant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To\naddress this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that\nintegrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density\nEstimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first\nemploys a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral\ndistribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is\napplied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine\nproper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI\nsolver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our\nmain experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,\nachieving up to a 5.63$\\times$ speedup.

Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human\nexperts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing\ncorrectness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More\nspecifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that\niteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating\nhardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive\nevaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,\nachieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$\nspeedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench.

The current supervised\nfine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets\nto train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize\neffectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,\nreinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and\ngeneralization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure\nRL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and\nenhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic\ngeneralization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively\nshifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on\nthis design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained\nto enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL\nfrom Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training).

In this work, we propose the\nQuantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework\nthat integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.\nThe framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that\njointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)\nquantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and\nmitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical\nparameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are\noptimized using parameter-shift gradients.

For OA and CVA\nscreening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model\nassigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically\nignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI\n[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe\nlaterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.\nThe primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an\ninterpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity.

While CCS has shown promise, its two-term\nobjective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with\nthe aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue\nthat what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building\non this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form\nsolutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple\nvariables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding\nthat they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around\nsensitivity to random initialization.

This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions.
