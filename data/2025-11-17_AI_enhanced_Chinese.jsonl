While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "LT-Soups: \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b soups \u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5747\u8861\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u6c42\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5934\u90e8\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u518d\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5934\u90e8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e PEFT \u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b soups\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5448\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5934\u90e8\u7c7b\u522b\u5360\u6bd4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5c3e\u90e8\u6781\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bPEFT \u5982 LoRA/AdaptFormer \u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u5c3e\u90e8\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u5934\u90e8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5934\u5c3e\u6bd4 \u03b7 \u4e0e\u5934\u90e8-\u5c3e\u90e8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u03c1 \u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8be5\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "1) \u6309\u5e73\u8861\u5b50\u96c6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b soups \u7684\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7684 LT-Soups \u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u5934\u90e8\u504f\u7f6e\uff1b2) \u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5934\u90e8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b3) \u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u03c1\u4e0e\u03b7\u7684 LT \u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e PEFT \u548c\u4f20\u7edf soups \u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684 LT \u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cLT-Soups \u5728\u5934\u90e8-\u5c3e\u90e8\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e PEFT \u548c\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u578b soups\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b soups \u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd LT \u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5934\u5c3e\u5e73\u8861\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address data scarcity and privacy constraints, we propose a novel transfer learning with model averaging framework that integrates information from heterogeneous data sources - including fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU data sets - without direct data sharing. For each source domain type, a tailored logistic regression model is conducted, and knowledge is transferred to the PU target domain through model averaging. Optimal weights for combining source models are determined via a cross-validation criterion that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish theoretical guarantees for weight optimality and convergence, covering both misspecified and correctly specified target models, with further extensions to high-dimensional settings using sparsity-penalized estimators.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings.

In the numerical experiments, we consider a drift function with local fluctuations generated by a double-layer compositional structure featuring local oscillations, and show that the empirical convergence rate becomes independent of the input dimension $d$.

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet when fairness constraints such as demographic parity are introduced, their effects on model coefficients, and thus on how predictive bias is distributed across features, remain opaque. Existing approaches on linear models often rely on strong and unrealistic assumptions, or overlook the explicit role of the sensitive attribute, limiting their practical utility for fairness assessment. We extend the work of (Chzhen and Schreuder, 2022) and (Fukuchi and Sakuma, 2023) by proposing a post-processing framework that can be applied on top of any linear model to decompose the resulting bias into direct (sensitive-attribute) and indirect (correlated-features) components. Our method analytically characterizes how demographic parity reshapes each model coefficient, including those of both sensitive and non-sensitive features. This enables a transparent, feature-level interpretation of fairness interventions and reveals how bias may persist or shift through correlated variables. Our framework requires no retraining and provides actionable insights for model auditing and mitigation.

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms.

Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations.

We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way.

We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%.

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration.

However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \\textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks.

This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness.

In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN).

Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect.

To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata.

A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering.

(2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization.

A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism.

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2.

HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "HealSplit \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411 Split Federated Learning \u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e94\u7c7b poisoning \u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "SFL \u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5728\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u4f20\u7edfFL\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4ec5\u8bbf\u95ee smashed data \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06 smashed data \u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u5e76\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u5f02\u5e38\u5f97\u5206 TAS \u8bc6\u522b\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u6837\u672c\uff1b2) \u751f\u6210\u6027\u4fee\u590d\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Vanilla Teacher \u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49 supervision \u4e0e AD Teacher \u63d0\u4f9b\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9876\u70b9\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5341\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u9632\u5fa1\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHealSplit \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "HealSplit \u4e3a SFL \u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool.

This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training.

Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time.

This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.\n  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u76f4\u89c9\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3a0\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u7531\u4e00\u90e8\u65b9\u5dee\u4e58\u4ee5Jacobian\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08MLP\u5728ETTm1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u76f4\u89c9\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7f3a\u53e3\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u6052\u4e3a0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u6790\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u7ed9\u51faJacobian\u57fa\u4e8e\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5728ETTm1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3a0\uff1b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u9012\u5f52\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u7ec4\u6210\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u7b49\u4e8e\u4e00\u6b65\u65b9\u5dee\u4e58\u4ee5Jacobian\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4f55\u65f6\u9012\u5f52\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u76f4\u89c9\u3002"}}

Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.\n  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing.

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group.

This is the extended version including the appendix", "summary": "In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.
