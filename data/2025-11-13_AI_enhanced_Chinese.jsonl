However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning.

We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments.

We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization.

The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory.

They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.\n  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Branching Flows\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u68ee\u6797\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u53c9\u548c\u6d88\u4ea1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u652f/\u5408\u6210\u7387\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u6297\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u86cb\u767d backbone \u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u94fe\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u652f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u68ee\u6797\u6784\u6210\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u5143\u7d20\u4ee5\u5206\u53c9\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u652f\u4e0e\u6d88\u4ea1\u901f\u7387\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u57fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\u3001\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u5149\u6ed1\u6d41\u5f62\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6f14\u793a\uff1a\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u3001\u6297\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\uff08\u79bb\u6563\uff09\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a Branching Flows \u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Branching Flows \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u7f1d\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u5b9a\u957f\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u90bb\u57df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u964d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee5\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u5b9a\u90bb\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u77e5\u540d\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u6709\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u964d\u7ef4\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + \u03c3Z$, where $\u03c3\\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\u03c3^4)$ and $O(\u03c3^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.\n  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \\[ \\mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \u03c3^2 \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \\[ \\mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \\frac{\u03c3^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] \\[ \\mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \\frac{\u03c3^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y) - \\frac{\u03c3^4}{8} \\nabla \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\nabla \\log q(y) \\|^2 + \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\log q(y) \\right) . \\]", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73 \u03c3 \u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03 P_Y \u6536\u655b\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03 P_X\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4 Tweedie \u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u5355\u70b9 X \u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa T1\u3001T2 \u7b49\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u548c Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re \u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ea\u77e5\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u800c\u975e\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03 P_Y \u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03 P_X\uff0c\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff08universal\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff08distributional denoisers\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03 q(y)=P_Y\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e Bayes-\u6700\u4f18 Tweedie \u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u66f4\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1aT1(y)=y+ (\u03c3^2/2) \u2207 log q(y) \u548c T2(y)=y+ (\u03c3^2/2) \u2207 log q(y) - (\u03c3^4/8) \u2207( 1/2 ||\u2207 log q(y)||^2 + \u0394 log q(y) )\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93/Monge-Amp\u00e8re \u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9 P_Y \u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6 q \u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e Tweedie \u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u5728\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03 P_X \u7684\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u77e9\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230 O(\u03c3^4) \u4e0e O(\u03c3^6) \u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u548c Monge-Amp\u00e8re \u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece Y \u91cd\u6784 P_X \u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf Bayes-optimal \u53bb\u566a\u66f4\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff08T1\u3001T2\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u53bb\u566a\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis.

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget.

We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs.

By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches.

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture.

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs.

However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update.

While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions.

An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information.

Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic to compute Background SHAP and other Shapley-type values efficiently; achieves large speedups on CPU and GPU; implemented in Python with NumPy/SciPy/CuPy.", "motivation": "Need scalable SHAP computation for large-scale tree ensembles and big background datasets.", "method": "Constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula per instance encoding feature values, tree structure, and background data; computes Background SHAP in linear time; supports Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values; CPU/GPU friendly without custom C++/CUDA.", "result": "Empirical results show 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, 127 features: Background SHAP computed in 162s CPU, 16s GPU; 16x/165x speedups vs best existing method.", "conclusion": "WOODELF enables fast, scalable SHAP and related game-theoretic values on standard hardware; facilitates large-scale interpretation workflows."}}

While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability.

Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres.

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "Probing-then-Editing\uff08PTE\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd retain-free \u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u64a4\u56de\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u63a8\u52a8\u53bb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u6ede\u540e\u64a4\u56de\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7684 IIoT \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5fd8\u8bb0\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97/\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0a\u5347\u5bf9\u5f85\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u6267\u884c\u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1apush \u5206\u652f\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u62c6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0cpull \u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u951a\u5b9a\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u5f85\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "PTE \u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728CWRU\u3001SCUT-FD\u7b49\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u65e0\u6ede\u540e\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 retain-free \u7684 PTE \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u4ed6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance.

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models", "comment": "6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words", "summary": "With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20.

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction).

A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets.
