Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

Abstract: Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

Abstract: We present discretize_distributions, a Python package that efficiently constructs discrete approximations of Gaussian mixture distributions and provides guarantees on the approximation error in Wasserstein distance. The package implements state-of-the-art quantization methods for Gaussian mixture models and extends them to improve scalability. It further integrates complementary quantization strategies such as sigma-point methods and provides a modular interface that supports custom schemes and integration into control and verification pipelines for cyber-physical systems. We benchmark the package on various examples, including high-dimensional, large, and degenerate Gaussian mixtures, and demonstrate that discretize_distributions produces accurate approximations at low computational cost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

Abstract: We present AccelOpt, a self-improving large language model (LLM) agentic system that autonomously optimizes kernels for emerging AI acclerators, eliminating the need for expert-provided hardware-specific optimization knowledge. AccelOpt explores the kernel optimization space through iterative generation, informed by an optimization memory that curates experiences and insights from previously encountered slow-fast kernel pairs. We build NKIBench, a new benchmark suite of AWS Trainium accelerator kernels with varying complexity extracted from real-world LLM workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of AccelOpt. Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing. Our code is available at \href{here}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GESC-1B22}.

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/EmorZz1G/STAND.

In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

Abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

Abstract: The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/LTI_LEO.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

Abstract: In this paper, we present gfnx, a fast and scalable package for training and evaluating Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) written in JAX. gfnx provides an extensive set of environments and metrics for benchmarking, accompanied with single-file implementations of core objectives for training GFlowNets. We include synthetic hypergrids, multiple sequence generation environments with various editing regimes and particular reward designs for molecular generation, phylogenetic tree construction, Bayesian structure learning, and sampling from the Ising model energy. Across different tasks, gfnx achieves significant wall-clock speedups compared to Pytorch-based benchmarks (such as torchgfn library) and author implementations. For example, gfnx achieves up to 55 times speedup on CPU-based sequence generation environments, and up to 80 times speedup with the GPU-based Bayesian network structure learning setup. Our package provides a diverse set of benchmarks and aims to standardize empirical evaluation and accelerate research and applications of GFlowNets. The library is available on GitHub (https://github.com/d-tiapkin/gfnx) and on pypi (https://pypi.org/project/gfnx/). Documentation is available on https://gfnx.readthedocs.io.

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实数据往往落在具有未知边界和高维点云的低维流形上，传统高斯过程难以捕捉几何结构，现有方法要么假设扁平平面的单一潜在坐标，要么在稀疏/不规则采样下性能不足。因此需要在未知拓扑几何上对热核进行估计并在回归中体现流形信息。

Method: 建立 Atlas BM 框架以估计点云上未知几何的热核；在此基础上通过将全局热核与局部 RBF 核结合，得到一个修正的黎曼度量核，形成 RC-AGP；将 RC-AGP 应用于合成与真实数据的回归任务。

Result: 所提出的方法在热核估计与回归精度方面优于现有方法，展现出对高维观测与流形推断之间的桥接能力。

Conclusion: RC-AGP 能有效利用复杂数据的几何/拓扑信息，提高统计推断能力，适用于具有未知几何与拓扑结构的点云数据的回归任务。

Abstract: In real-world applications, data often reside in restricted domains with unknown boundaries, or as high-dimensional point clouds lying on a lower-dimensional, nontrivial, unknown manifold. Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture the underlying geometry in such settings. Some existing methods assume a flat space embedded in a point cloud, which can be represented by a single latent chart (latent space), while others exhibit weak performance when the point cloud is sparse or irregularly sampled. The goal of this work is to address these challenges. The main contributions are twofold: (1) We establish the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for estimating the heat kernel on point clouds with unknown geometries and nontrivial topological structures; (2) Instead of directly using the heat kernel estimates, we construct a Riemannian corrected kernel by combining the global heat kernel with local RBF kernel and leading to the formulation of Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs). The resulting RC-AGPs are applied to regression tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets. These examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both heat kernel estimation and regression accuracy. It improves statistical inference by effectively bridging the gap between complex, high-dimensional observations and manifold-based inferences.

Abstract: Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.

Abstract: Linear probes are widely used to interpret and evaluate neural representations, yet their reliability remains unclear, as probes may appear accurate in some regimes but collapse unpredictably in others. We uncover a spectral mechanism behind this phenomenon and formalize it as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), a verifiable Fisher-inspired condition for probe stability. When the eigengap separating task-relevant directions is larger than the Fisher estimation error, the estimated subspace concentrates and accuracy remains consistent, whereas closing this gap induces instability in a phase-transition manner. Our analysis connects eigengap geometry, sample size, and misclassification risk through finite-sample reasoning, providing an interpretable diagnostic rather than a loose generalization bound. Controlled synthetic studies, where Fisher quantities are computed exactly, confirm these predictions and show how spectral inspection can anticipate unreliable probes before they distort downstream evaluation.

Abstract: This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a broad class of time distributions. We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.

Abstract: We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate
  \begin{equation*}
  \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),
  \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.
  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $η\le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.
  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].
  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].
  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.
  Our work has two key technical contributions:
  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,
  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.
