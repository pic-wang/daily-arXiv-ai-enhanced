Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Research aimed at scaling up neuroscience inspired learning algorithms for neural networks is accelerating. Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-oracle top-k identification with STC baseline, ACE adaptive certification, and ACE-W adaptive weak-budget method. All achieve asymptotic strong-call bound O(m(4ε_max)) with practical reductions; lower bound Ω(m(ε_max)).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying the top-k items when exact valuations are expensive; use a fast noisy weak oracle and a scarce high-fidelity strong oracle; minimize strong-verification calls while maintaining correctness.

Method: 1) Screen-then-Certify (STC) baseline using weak confidence intervals with radius ε_max; bound on strong calls: ≤ m(4ε_max). 2) ACE adaptive certification focusing strong queries on critical boundary items; achieves same bound with practical gains. 3) ACE-W fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before ACE to further reduce strong costs.

Result: Theoretical bound: strong calls capped by O(m(4ε_max)) for STC and ACE; Conditional lower bound Ω(m(ε_max)); ACE matches the STC bound but reduces strong calls in practice; ACE-W further reduces strong costs by reallocating weak budget.

Conclusion: Adaptive certification (ACE) and its weak-budget variant (ACE-W) effectively reduce reliance on expensive strong oracle while preserving accuracy in top-k identification under weak uncertainty around the threshold.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

TL;DR: A generative foundation model SIGMA-PPG for PPG signals using prior-guided masking and vector quantization, achieving robust performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses redundancy/noise in PPG and limitations of masked/contrastive models; seeks morphological precision and semantic consistency.

Method: Statistical-prior informed generative masking (Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking) with reinforcement-learning teacher; semantic consistency via vector quantization; pre-trained on 120k hours; codebook density improved.

Result: Outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines on 12 downstream tasks; strong average performance; code available.

Conclusion: SIGMA-PPG is effective for robust PPG representation learning, combining priors and semantic coding to reduce redundancy and overfitting; enables better downstream results and open-source access.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ZonghengGuo/SigmaPPG.

Motivation: 在奖励函数对组合对象未知且具有可观测结构的情形下，如何高效地利用有限的查询来训练生成式采样模型。通过利用奖励的子模性来获得未观测对象的上界，从而实现对未知对象的乐观性探索并扩展训练数据。

Conclusion: 将子模上界融入 GFlowNets 的训练框架可显著提升数据利用率和生成性能，证明了在子模奖励结构下对未知对象进行乐观性探索的有效性与潜力。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种受约束的扩散模型采样框架，通过对可行集合定义受约束的前向过程，并提出 Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) 算法在迭代中交替去噪、投影和再加噪，实现对约束样本的采样。实验表明该方法在约束违反性方面显著下降，且样本与真实约束分布更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学应用中，神经仿真器需要遵守物理定律或观测一致性，但 vanilla 扩散模型难以保证严格的物理约束，因此需引入在生成时就强制满足约束的采样机制。

Method: 定义一个仅在可行约束集上的扩散前向过程，使边际分布仅在该集合内；提出 Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) 迭代算法，通过交替执行去噪预测、投影到可行集、再噪声化来从约束边际中采样。

Result: 在二维分布、偏微分方程( PDE )和全球天气预报任务上，PPR 将约束违背显著降低（超一数量级），提升样本一致性，并且比基线更好地匹配真实的约束分布。

Conclusion: 将约束条件直接整合到扩散采样流程中可显著提升物理可行性与观测一致性；PPR 提供了一有效的迭代框架用于从约束边际中采样，具有在科学建模中推广的潜力。

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

### [22] [The Powers of Precision: Structure-Informed Detection in Complex Systems -- From Customer Churn to Seizure Onset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21170)
*Augusto Santos,Teresa Santos,Catarina Rodrigues,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learn a representation from a one-parameter family of estimators (covariance/precision powers) to detect emergent critical events; combined with a supervised classifier, with proven structural consistency and interpretable structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent phenomena (e.g., seizures, churn, outbreaks) arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. Early detection requires uncovering latent structure from partially observed, unknown data-generating processes while providing interpretable insights.

Method: Construct feature representations from powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix (a one-parameter family of estimators). Select the optimal power to align with the latent structure, then train a supervised classifier on this representation. Prove structural consistency of the estimator family.

Result: Empirical validation on seizure detection and churn prediction shows competitive performance. The optimal covariance power also exhibits good identifiability and captures meaningful structural signatures, offering explainability alongside prediction.

Conclusion: The approach achieves strong predictive performance while aligning with interpretable statistical structure, reconciling accuracy with understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms driving critical events.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决平均奖励MDP中缺乏Bellman算子收缩性的问题；在不依赖强制收缩假设的情况下，给出接近最优的非渐进样本复杂度。

Method: 引入懒化动态（在当前状态以固定概率停留），构造一个实例相关的半范数，并在该半范数下对经懒化处理的Bellman算子实现一阶收缩；对同步与异步Q-learning给出收敛性分析。

Result: 在 reachability 假设下，证明简单变体的Q-learning可实现 	ilde{O}(ε^{-2}) 的样本复杂度，且不需要外部强收缩假设。核心在于半范数与懒化转换使得Bellman算子具备收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出一种新的分析框架：通过懒化MDP与实例相关半范数实现对平均奖励MDP的Q-learning收敛性且达到最优样本复杂度，适用于同步与异步更新。

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

### [26] [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462)
*Shihao Shao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Partial-feedback online learning is characterized in the set-realizable regime: deterministic learners are governed by the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and randomized learners by the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim). The framework yields near-complete minimax regret characterizations, shows conditions under which deterministic and randomized learnability diverge, extends to set-valued predictions, and reveals sharp gaps outside realizability where even simple cases can incur linear regret, motivating new complexity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world tasks (e.g., language generation) admit multiple correct outputs but only a single reference (partial feedback). Understanding learnability and optimal regret under such partial feedback is crucial for designing robust online learning algorithms.

Method: Introduce new complexity notions tailored to partial feedback: PFLdim for deterministic learners and PMSdim for randomized learners, derived via a novel collection version space and auxiliary dimensions. Provide minimax regret bounds in the set-realizable regime, analyze inseparability conditions (e.g., finite Helly number, nested label structures), extend results to set-valued online learning, and compare with weaker realizability and agnostic settings.

Result: PFLdim precisely governs deterministic learnability and minimax regret; PMSdim yields tight bounds for randomized learners; identified broad conditions causing deterministic/randomized inseparability; resolved open question for set-valued online learning; outside set realizability, linear regret can occur even with only two labels, indicating the need for new noise-sensitive complexity measures.

Conclusion: The work delivers a near-complete theory for partial-feedback set-realizable online learning, highlighting fundamental differences between deterministic and randomized learners, and exposing sharp limitations outside realizable settings that motivate future research into noise-aware complexity measures.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

TL;DR: 提出 Reset-and-Discard (ReD) 策略，通过在给定预算下提升覆盖率 coverage@cost，从而提升对大型语言模型的回答覆盖性，同时能推断或预测 power-law 指数；在 HumanEval 任务上对三种LLM显著降低了达到目标覆盖所需的尝试、token和成本。


<details>

Motivation: 现有评估常用 pass@k，在固定预算下存在边际报酬递减的问题，coverage@cost 能更真实反映成本效率；两者存在不一致需要连接；若能在无 pass@k 情况下推断功率-law 指数则更有用。

Method: 提出 ReD 策略：重置对话/舍弃过去的尝试，以增加新问题的独立性并提升覆盖率，且对任意 form 的 pass@k 都有效；能以给定的 pass@k 预测节省的总尝试次数；若没有 pass@k，ReD 能推断其幂律指数。

Result: 在三种LLM的 HumanEval 实验中，ReD 显著降低达到所需覆盖的尝试次数、token数量和成本；同时提供一种高效测量推理功率-law 的方法。

Conclusion: ReD 提供一种通用、成本敏感的评估与优化工具，能提升覆盖率、减少成本，并帮助解析和预测模型的幂律行为。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

Conclusion: 提供一种更通用、无采样且对小 ε 友好的隐私放大分析框架，扩展到任意带/非带矩阵机制，提升矩阵机制在研究和实践中的隐私保障能力。

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/marvinsxtr/MapPFN.

TL;DR: ECSEL learns closed-form signomial expressions for classification, providing an interpretable model that is competitive with black-box classifiers and reveals dataset biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many symbolic regression benchmarks exhibit compact signomial structure; there is a need for interpretable classifiers and explanations. The method aims to analyze global feature behavior, decision boundaries, and local feature attributions to expose biases and enable counterfactual reasoning.

Method: Directly construct a structural, closed-form signomial expression as the classifier and explanation. The method emphasizes global behavior, decision boundary analysis, and local attributions, and evaluates on symbolic regression benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Result: ECSEL recovers a larger fraction of target equations with much less computation than state-of-the-art approaches on symbolic regression benchmarks. Classification accuracy is competitive with established ML models while maintaining interpretability. The learned equations reveal dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and provide actionable insights in real-world case studies (e-commerce and fraud detection).

Conclusion: ECSEL offers an efficient, interpretable classification approach with strong explanatory capabilities and practical utility for real-world problems.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of ambient and intrinsic representations: embedded source subspace plus low-rank innovations and sparse edits, with an anchored alternating projection estimator and deterministic error bounds; theoretical guarantees for Markov transition estimation and covariance estimation with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study transfer learning when both ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation grow, by embedding a well-estimated source task as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task to achieve improved Sample complexity and accuracy with controlled representation growth.

Method: Decompose the target parameter into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits. Introduce an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves the transferred subspaces while estimating only the low-rank innovations and sparse modifications. Derive deterministic error bounds separating target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error.

Result: Deterministic error bounds showing strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small. End-to-end theoretical guarantees for Markov transition matrix estimation under dependent noise. Complementary analysis for structured covariance estimation in enlarged dimensions and empirical validation of transfer gains.

Conclusion: The framework is general, enabling subspace transfer under growth of ambient and intrinsic representations, with provable improvements when rank and sparsity increments are modest and empirical validation supporting practical gains.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

### [39] [TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21135)
*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 TRACE：用混合专家框架处理连续的因果机制过渡，将转变视为若干原子机制的凸组合，并可在测试时恢复混合轨迹；在理论上证明潜在变量和混合轨迹可联合辨识，实验显示高相关性与优于离散切换 baselines。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实系统中的因果机制往往连续演化而非瞬时离散切换，需建立可辨识的连续过渡模型以准确建模与推断。

Method: 将过渡机制建模为有限原子机制的凸组合，且混合系数随时间变化；提出 TRACE，采用 Mixture-of-Experts，每个 expert 学习一个原子机制；训练时学习原子机制，测试时估计混合轨迹，且可推广至训练中未观察到的中间状态。

Result: 在合成与真实数据中，TRACE 能以最高达 0.99 的相关性恢复混合轨迹，显著优于离散切换基线。

Conclusion: 潜在变量与连续混合轨迹可联合辨识，方法具有对未观测中间状态的泛化能力，适用于现实系统的连续因果建模。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

Result: 在不同原子系统上，动态截断实现2.26x的内存节省、约2.04x的推理速度提升，且与固定截断的精度差异很小；材料和分子数据集均表现良好。

Conclusion: 动态截断为MLIP提供了可扩展的计算框架，兼顾稳定性和精度，具备广泛适用性并且公开源代码，利于后续的应用和研究。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

### [43] [Learning to Advect: A Neural Semi-Lagrangian Architecture for Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21151)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARADIS: a physics-inspired modular weather model that decomposes advection, diffusion, and reaction on latent variables; uses Neural Semi-Lagrangian advection on the sphere, depthwise spatial mixing, and channel interactions; achieves state-of-the-art forecast with far lower training cost (1° ERA5) than 0.25° baselines and rivals ECMWF HRES and GraphCast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic neural weather models struggle to accurately capture advection and long-range transport, leading to high training costs and suboptimal generalization. Introducing inductive biases by explicitly modeling key physical processes (advection, diffusion, reaction) can improve data efficiency and forecast skill.

Method: Functional decomposition into: (1) advection via Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator with differentiable interpolation on the sphere for trajectory-based transport; (2) diffusion via depthwise-separable spatial mixing; (3) local source terms/vertical interactions via pointwise channel interactions. End-to-end learning of latent modes and their transport trajectories. Training on ERA5 benchmarks at 1-degree resolution, with relatively low compute (<1 GPU-month).

Result: PARADIS delivers state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1° model meets or exceeds 0.25° traditional and ML baselines, including ECMWF HRES and DeepMind GraphCast.

Conclusion: A modular, physics-informed architecture can outperform monolithic neural networks in weather forecasting while drastically reducing training costs, suggesting broader applicability of operator-level physical structure in geophysical forecasting.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

Motivation: 解决联邦场景下簇数未知、局部簇集合异质且可能重叠的问题；在不共享原始数据的前提下，推断全局簇结构。

Conclusion: FedGEM 提供了一个系统的、可验证的框架，用于在未知簇数和局部簇集合异质性的联邦聚类任务中进行推断和学习，具有理论保障和实证优越性。

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

Motivation: 在 logistic 框架下缺乏简单遗憾理论结果，需结合情境线性带与自共轭分析，提出可行且可算的算法，并给出理论和实验支持。

Method: 基于情境线性带与自共轭分析提出首个实现简单遗憾的算法，结合自协方差分析与自共轭分析。提出新变体的 Thompson Sampling，适用于简单遗憾场景；并将方法扩展至 logistic 情况，得到同样形式的简单遗憾界限。

Result: 简单遗憾界限为  O(d/ sqrt{T})，leading term 不含 κ=O(exp(S))；若行动集有限，则算法可完全可解；随机化算法给出  O(d^{3/2}/ sqrt{T})；扩展到 logistic，得到同样的界限且 leading term 仍无 κ；并有数值实验支持理论。

Conclusion: 首次在 stochastic contextual logistic bandits 中给出简单遗憾界限，且随机化方法更低计算成本；结果将简单遗憾理论推广到 logistic 框架，消除 κ 对 leading term 的影响，具有理论与实践意义。

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

TL;DR: Flow Perturbation++ 提供一种多步、方差降低的无偏 Jacobian 估计，在概率流 ODE 离散化的框架内，将 Flow Perturbation 的无偏性+多步累积实现，显著提升高维 CNF 的采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维系统中 CNF 的雅可比行列式成本高，现有的 Hutchinson 估计引入偏差，单步 Flow Perturbation 虽无偏但方差高。需要一种在保持无偏性的同时降低估计方差的方法以提升效率。

Method: 将概率流 ODE 离散化，与逐步无偏的雅可比估计结合，提出 Flow Perturbation++，在每个积分步骤进行无偏雅可比估计，形成多步构造；并将该估计整合入 Sequential Monte Carlo 框架。

Result: 在 1000D 高斯混合模型和全原子 Chignolin 蛋白上，Flow Perturbation++ 相比 Hutchinson 基线和单步 Flow Perturbation 基线，显著提升了平衡采样效果。

Conclusion: Flow Perturbation++ 能在保持无偏性的前提下显著降低方差，从而提升高维 CNF 的采样效率，适用于大规模无偏 Boltzmann 采样场景。

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

Result: 在 MNIST、CIFAR-10、FFHQ 256x256 上实现稳定的保真度与覆盖提升；以 MNIST 为例，基线 FID 3.95，经潜在空间 Refinement 达到 1.46 的 state-of-the-art FID，且仅需要 1-NFE；并保持样本多样性。

Conclusion: BFR 提供一个低成本、有效的后处理偏差修正方案，适用于扩展到高维生成任务的流-扩散模型，显著提升样本质量而不干扰原有采样轨迹。

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

Motivation: SSVEP信号在不同个体之间存在显著变异，且高质量的用户特异注释成本高，限制了识别性能。因此需要跨 subject 的领域自适应和更强的特征学习，以提高泛化和降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解跨主体变异和标注成本对SSVEP-BCI识别的影响，提供了一种可扩展的跨-subject自训练范式，并通过时频对比学习提升特征区分性，具有良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

Conclusion: 将GDL/TDL置于几何拓扑背景，有助于理解特征扩散机制并为未来研究提供新的分析工具和方向。

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在数据稀疏场景中提出 PHDME，结合 GP-dPHS 与扩散模型，通过物理/能量结构先验实现对不完整物理信息的鲁棒预测，并通过分段保真度校准给出不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏数据下扩散模型对轨迹预测的可靠性不足；传统物理信息机器学习通常需要显式的 governing equations，且往往只部分已知。需要一个不要求完整方程但可利用能量结构的框架。

Result: 在数据稀缺情形下，PHDME 显著提升了预测精度和物理一致性；GP-dPHS 提供能量结构的鲁棒表示，人工数据帮助扩散模型学习复杂动力学；分割保标校准提供可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: PHDME 展示了无需完整显式方程即可在不完全物理信息下实现鲁棒预测的潜力，结合结构化物理先验与扩散模型与不确定性分布实现快速且可信的轨迹生成，适用于 PDE 基准和实际系统的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

Motivation: RLVR 在有限 rollout 预算下探索效率低，原因不仅仅是难度，常见是少数干扰性提示令牌带来的干扰导致采样失败。

Method: LENS 先通过 purifier 阶段识别并去除干扰令牌，对干净提示进行 rollout 以获得成功的样本；随后将 purification 阶段的成功 rollout 用于监督原噪声提示下的策略优化，使模型学会在现实世界的噪声提示中忽略干扰。

Result: 实验显示 LENS 显著超越 GRPO，提升性能、加速收敛，平均提升 3.88%，并实现 1.6x 的加速。

Conclusion: 强调在提高 rollout 效率方面，去除干扰令牌具有关键作用，为 RLVR 研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical method for chemical substance detection, but measurement reliability tends to deteriorate in the presence of interfering substances. In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EGAM extends GAM by updating both node and edge embeddings using multi-head dot-product attention, enabling better handling of edge information in routing graphs. It uses an autoregressive encoder-decoder trained with policy gradient and a specialized baseline, achieving competitive or superior performance, especially on highly constrained routing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GAMs consider only node features, limiting the model's ability to capture edge interactions essential for routing problems. Incorporating edge features and a more expressive attention mechanism should improve performance on complex graphs.

Method: Generalize the graph attention mechanism to update both node and edge embeddings with multi-head dot-product attention. Use an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture. Train with policy gradient reinforcement learning and a specially designed baseline to reduce variance.

Result: EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems, with particularly strong performance on highly constrained problems, illustrating efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

Conclusion: Extending GAM to edge-aware, multi-head attention within an autoregressive RL framework yields robust improvements for neural combinatorial optimization on routing problems, especially under tight constraints.

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers, implemented with graph neural networks (GNNs), have introduced new approaches for solving routing problems. Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

TL;DR: DUET是一种基于蒸馏的“教师-学生”未学习方法。通过让一个提示引导的教师拒绝不良知识并教导学生模仿其行为，在保留通用知识的同时实现对不良知识的遏制，相较于现有方法数据效率高、遗忘效果好、对实用性保留更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有未学习方法要么需要高成本的重新训练（调优类方法），要么在可控性与鲁棒性之间取舍，面对对不良知识的依赖性和潜在逆向工程的风险。需要在不重新训练的前提下实现显著的遗忘，同时保持模型的通用能力。

Method: 提出基于蒸馏的未学习框架DUET。通过一个提示引导的教师模型对不良知识进行拒绝输出的行为进行编码，并训练一个学生模型模仿该教师的输出策略，以在不损害通用知识的前提下实现对不良知识的遗忘。该过程强调数据效率，使用对比或模仿学习促进学生对教师策略的学习，相比传统的微调或无上下文未学习，具有更低的数据需求和更强的鲁棒性。

Result: 在已有基准上，DUET在遗忘效果与实用性保留方面都达到更高的表现，并且数据效率比最先进的未学习方法高出若干量级。

Conclusion: DUET成功地结合了两大未学习思路的优点：通过蒸馏实现精确且高效的未学习，同时大幅提升数据利用率，显示蒸馏型未学习是一个有前景的方向，值得在更多场景中进一步验证与扩展。

Abstract: LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统中，捕捉丰富且多粒度的特征交互对于提升预测效果至关重要。随着模型容量的增加，提升性能的潜力显著，但需要在不显著增加推理延迟的情况下实现扩展性和高效性，因此需要一种能够高效处理高维特征的可扩展架构。

Conclusion: Zenith通过高效的Token处理策略和增强的特征交互能力，证明了在大规模在线排序任务中的可扩展性与实际效用，能在降低延迟的同时提升关键用户参与与体验指标。

Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.

*Akash Pandey,Payal Mohapatra,Wei Chen,Qi Zhu,Sinan Keten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeSliver proposing a explainability-driven framework for time-series classification that combines raw data with symbolic abstraction to produce a representation where each temporal segment's contribution is linearly encoded, enabling per-time-point attribution. It achieves 11% improvement over other temporal attribution methods on 7 datasets and remains within 2% of SOTA on 26 UEA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc gradient/feature attributions suffer from reference-state sensitivity and poor generalization across time-series datasets, and attention-based explanations often fail to faithfully reflect temporal importance. A representation that preserves temporal structure and provides meaningful per-time-point attribution could improve both explainability and predictive performance.

Method: A framework that jointly uses raw time-series data and a symbolic abstraction to construct a representation preserving temporal structure. Each element linearly encodes the contribution of its corresponding temporal segment, enabling a straightforward per-time-point importance score.

Result: Empirical results show TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets and achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines on 26 UEA datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating raw data with symbolic abstraction yields faithful temporal attributions and competitive accuracy, suggesting a promising direction for explainable time-series classification.

Abstract: Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PG-TMT: a compact tri-branch encoder for reliability-centered prognostics in rotating machinery, combining physics-guided representations with EVT-calibrated, threshold-based decisions for calibrated, interpretable early warnings under nonstationary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early warning signals must remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts, and severe class imbalance, while keeping false alarms small and predictable. The work aims to integrate physics priors with data-driven modeling and EVT-based calibration for reliable, deployable prognostics.

Method: A three-branch encoder: (1) depthwise-separable convolutional stem for micro-transients; (2) Tiny-Mamba state-space branch for near-linear long-range dynamics; (3) lightweight local Transformer for cross-channel resonances. An analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping ties attention to fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score for physical plausibility. Healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT) to achieve a target false-alarm intensity, with dual-threshold hysteresis and minimum hold time to suppress chatter. A leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring across multiple datasets demonstrates cross-domain transfer.

Result: PG-TMT achieves higher precision-recall AUC under imbalance, competitive or superior ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, with strong cross-domain transfer.

Conclusion: Coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules yields calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centered prognostics and health management.

Abstract: Reliability-centered prognostics for rotating machinery requires early warning signals that remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts across speed/load/sensors, and severe class imbalance, while keeping the false-alarm rate small and predictable. We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.

Conclusion: 提供了一个以信息性和效用性为理论支撑的系统化数据集蒸馏框架，能显著提升大规模数据集上的蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

Motivation: Challenging the conventional wisdom that long-horizon predictions and compounding errors are the main obstacles for model-based RL; the authors show that distribution shift is the critical bottleneck for search-based methods.

Method: Systematically identifying and applying techniques that mitigate distribution shift during search, and empirically evaluating their impact on performance across multiple benchmark domains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across several popular benchmark domains.

Conclusion: Reducing distribution shift is more impactful for search-based model-based RL than simply improving model or value-function accuracy; with the right techniques, search can be effective.

Abstract: This paper investigates search in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). Conventional wisdom holds that long-term predictions and compounding errors are the primary obstacles for model-based RL. We challenge this view, showing that search is not a plug-and-play replacement for a learned policy. Surprisingly, we find that search can harm performance even when the model is highly accurate. Instead, we show that mitigating distribution shift matters more than improving model or value function accuracy. Building on this insight, we identify key techniques for enabling effective search, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple popular benchmark domains.

Conclusion: TGCC提供了一种可迁移、信息保真且适用于跨任务跨域的图数据集凝练解决方案，证明了因果不变性和光谱域对比学习在提升压缩数据集的泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: The increasing scale of graph datasets has significantly improved the performance of graph representation learning methods, but it has also introduced substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a statistical learning problem when the distribution of training (source) data is different from that of test (target) data. In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments under various distribution shift scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, especially when target data are extremely scarce.

Abstract: We propose a new convex loss for SVMs, both for the binary classification and for the regression models. Therefore, we show the mathematical derivation of the dual problems and we experiment them with several small data-sets. The minimal dimension of those data-sets is due to the difficult scalability of the SVM method to bigger instances. This preliminary study should prove that using pattern correlations inside the loss function could enhance the generalisation performances. Coherently, results show that generalisation measures are never worse than the standard losses and several times they are better. In our opinion, it should be considered a careful study of this loss, coupled with shallow and deep neural networks. In fact, we present some novel results obtained with those architectures.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: L2R 提供一个统一的路由框架，重塑路由空间和评分几何，跨域提升 MoE 的稳定性与效果，具有良好的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale neural networks by conditionally activating a small subset of experts, where the router plays a central role in determining expert specialization and overall model performance. However, many modern MoE systems still adopt linear routers in raw high-dimensional representation spaces, where representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring can jointly undermine routing discriminability and stable expert specialization. In this work, we propose Low-rank \& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness. Extensive experiments on a large-scale language MoE model and a vision MoE setting on ImageNet demonstrate that L2R consistently improves routing stability, expert specialization, and overall model performance.

Abstract: A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.

Abstract: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

TL;DR: FedGALA aligns graph and language modalities in federated settings by unsupervised contrastive learning between GNNs and frozen PLMs in a continuous embedding space, plus prompt-based tuning for efficient adaptation, achieving superior performance with reduced communication and without full-parameter fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study tackles the combined challenges of federated graph foundation models: data distribution heterogeneity, privacy constraints, knowledge loss from vector quantization, and the need to reconcile semantic-structural information between PLMs and GNNs to enable effective knowledge transfer.

Method: Unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNN encoders with frozen PLMs in a shared continuous embedding space, followed by communication-efficient prompt tuning to adapt to downstream tasks without full-parameter fine-tuning, within a federated, privacy-preserving setting.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows FedGALA outperforms competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets and tasks, with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Conclusion: FedGALA effectively resolves semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between PLMs and GNNs in federated graph learning, enabling robust, transferable knowledge while reducing communication overhead and avoiding full model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.
  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在后训练阶段通过奖励函数引导的生成偏好易导致过度推理（overthinking），尤其在处理简单任务时资源浪费明显。此外，缺乏对任务难度的显式感知和资源分配机制。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的训练框架DiPO，使用自我推理形成的难度建模来估计任务复杂度，并将其整合进奖励函数以约束冗长推理。难度建模依赖模型自我推理，降低对人工标注的依赖；设计了难度信号增强的奖励函数，考虑推理性能、输出格式以及推理长度的惩罚。

Result: 实验显示DiPO使模型能够自发调整推理开销，显著减少冗余输出的token数量，同时并未因思维压缩而降低推理性能。

Conclusion: DiPO有效提升LRMs对任务难度的感知与资源分配能力，在保持性能的前提下提升推理效率，降低对推理资源的浪费。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.

### [76] [Revisiting Diffusion Model Predictions Through Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21419)
*Qing Jin,Chaoyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for diffusion/flow model targets that links data geometry to the optimal prediction target, showing x-prediction is advantageous in high ambient dimension; introduces k-Diff to learn the target parameter k from data and improve generation across latent and pixel spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why the optimal prediction target depends on data properties and provide a general formulation that subsumes epsilon-, v-, and x-prediction. Bridge the gap between empirical shifts toward x-prediction and theoretical understanding, enabling principled choice of targets.

Method: Propose a generalized prediction framework with arbitrary output targets (including ε, v, x as special cases). Derive analytical relationships between data geometry (dimensionality, intrinsic structure) and the optimal target. Identify dimensionality as a key governing factor. Introduce k-Diff, a data-driven method to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data without estimating intrinsic dimension. Validate via experiments in latent-space and pixel-space image generation across architectures and scales.

Result: The analysis shows that when ambient dimension is much larger than intrinsic dimension, x-prediction is theoretically superior. k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines, demonstrating robustness to architecture and data scale in both latent and pixel spaces.

Conclusion: Data geometry governs the choice of prediction target; a data-driven approach like k-Diff can automatically select the optimal target, enabling principled and improved generative performance without explicit intrinsic-dimension estimation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

TL;DR: ConceptMoE提出一种动态对齐的“概念-单元”，通过将语义相似的token合并为概念表示，进行隐式的token级计算分配，以减少不必要的注意力与KV缓存计算，并通过与标准MoE等效的基准对比来 isolating architectural benefits。整体在语言、长上下文理解和多模态任务上表现出小幅提升，同时显著提高效率（如R=2时的_prefill与解码速度提升），且在持续训练中 gains 更大，表明其在实际应用中的潜在价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在所有tokens上分配均等的计算的问题：某些序列可预测性强，另一些需要深度推理；需要动态、概念级别的计算分配以提高效率和效能。

Method: 引入可学习的chunk模块，通过测量 token 之间的相似度来识别最佳边界，将序列按照目标比率R压缩，然后输入到计算密集的概念模型；MoE架构允许将节省的计算重新分配以匹配基线FLOPs和总参数，从而实现可控评估，避免注意力映射和KV缓存计算的干扰。

Result: 在语言和视觉-语言任务中，ConceptMoE连续超越标准MoE：语言预训练+0.9点、长上下文理解+2.3点、多模态基准+0.6点；在持续训练中通过层循环可达+5.5点；在R=2时，偏好(prefill)加速高达175%，解码加速高达117%；注意力计算可降低至R^2倍，KV缓存降低至R倍。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需最小化的架构修改即可与现有MoE无缝集成，展示自适应概念级处理能显著提升大模型的有效性和效率，强调计算资源的可控分配是提升大模型性能的关键路径之一。

Abstract: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

Abstract: Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding. These results highlight the practical value of revisiting Gray-Wyner theory in modern machine learning contexts, bridging classic information theory with task-driven representation learning.

Conclusion: MADI 有效缓解跨模态对齐与语义混合问题，提升对时间序列的理解与推理能力。

Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

Abstract: While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

Abstract: LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 通过将嵌入扩展到解码器层并采用静态路由，L^3实现了更高效的稀疏性、保留上下文信息、并在实际任务中超越密集模型和等稀疏MoE的表现。

Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training alignment for language models is effective, but also costly and unstable in practice, owing to its complicated training process. To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.

*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在任务特定的潜在结构中对LLM输出进行建模，提出一种贝叶斯最优解码框架，通过潜在结构的相异性度量来合成新的响应，优于传统束搜索，并能通过贝叶斯风险进行不确定性估计与任务对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码和不确定性估计方法仅在语言空间进行，忽略了输出可能的结构信息（如离散标签、数值、图等）。许多应用需要对结构化输出进行可靠且任务相关的预测，因此需要在潜在结构空间中进行解码和不确定性量化。

Method: 将LLM输出建模为任务相关的潜在结构，给该结构定义一个相异性度量，通过贝叶斯最小化策略合成新的响应而非采样结果；以潜在结构的贝叶斯风险来量化不确定性，并在不同任务中比较与标准解码方法（如束搜索）的表现。

Result: 在多种任务中，贝叶斯最优解码的输出优于束搜索等传统解码，且通过贝叶斯风险的不确定性度量能够更好地与输出质量和正确性对齐。

Conclusion: 该决策理论框架适用于任何具备潜在输出结构的问题，能够实现面向任务的可靠LLM预测。

Abstract: In many applications of LLMs, natural language responses often have an underlying structure such as representing discrete labels, numerical values, or graphs. Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

Abstract: Many-Task Learning refers to the setting where a large number of related tasks need to be learned, the exact relationships between tasks are not known. We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.

Abstract: Spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and lie on a Riemannian manifold, yet the theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics remains unexplored. We provide a formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds, establishing three theoretical results: (1) BWSPD's $\sqrtκ$ gradient conditioning (vs $κ$ for Log-Euclidean) via Daleckii-Kreĭn matrices provides better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs ($d \geq 22$), with this advantage reducing on low-dimensional inputs ($d \leq 8$) where eigendecomposition overhead dominates; (2) Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) approximates Riemannian normalization up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ error, yielding $+26\%$ accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, matching the channel-count-dependent prediction; (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds prove BWSPD tokens preserve manifold distances with distortion governed solely by the condition ratio $κ$. We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.

Conclusion: MoME 为多模态时间序列预测提供一个新的 MoE 级联思路，能更好地利用文本信号来动态调参和路由，从而提高预测准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of specific training data from a model, a need driven by privacy regulations and robustness concerns. Existing approaches typically modify model parameters, but such updates can be unstable, computationally costly, and limited by local approximations. We introduce Representation Unlearning, a framework that performs unlearning directly in the model's representation space. Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架能在不被分布统计干扰的情况下解耦因果机制的学习，并实现更精确的结构对应和高保真生成。

Abstract: Causal Disentangled Representation Learning(CDRL) aims to learn and disentangle low dimensional representations and their underlying causal structure from observations. However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.

### [92] [Bridging Functional and Representational Similarity via Usable Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21568)
*Antonio Almudévar,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified usable-information framework to quantify representation similarity across functional and representational dimensions, revealing the asymmetry of stitching, the estimator roles of reconstruction-based metrics (e.g., CKA, RSA), and a task-granularity hierarchy where input reconstruction defines the maximum granularity; representational similarity can be sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to unify how we quantify similarity between representations by connecting functional performance, representational structure, and the observer's predictive capacity, bridging gaps between existing metrics and clarifying how task granularity affects similarity.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing links between stitching performance and conditional mutual information; demonstration of inherent asymmetry in stitching requiring bidirectional comparison; analysis showing reconstruction-based metrics estimate usable information under predictive-capacity constraints; proof that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity; formulation of a task-granularity hierarchy where similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on coarser derivatives, with input reconstruction as the limit.

Result: Formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information; stitching is inherently asymmetric, necessitating bidirectional analysis; reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under certain constraints; similarity depends on the capacity of the predictive family, so more expressive observers may see sameness where rigid ones see differences; representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity; a task-granularity hierarchy shows that similarity on a complex task implies similarity on any coarser derivative, with input reconstruction representing the maximal granularity; unifies notions of representational and functional similarity.

Conclusion: Representational similarity is the maximal granularity achievable (input reconstruction), and usable information provides a coherent framework to compare representations across functional and representational dimensions. Robust comparisons require bidirectional analyses, and common metrics (CKA/RSA) should be interpreted as estimators under observer constraints; the framework clarifies how task granularity governs when similarity transfers across derivatives.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for quantifying the similarity between representations through the lens of \textit{usable information}, offering a rigorous theoretical and empirical synthesis across three key dimensions. First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.

TL;DR: 通过在预训练阶段对数据进行筛选，尤其按 token 级别进行筛选，以降低模型的 undesired capabilities（如医疗能力），在不同规模模型上证明 token 过滤比文档过滤更有效且成本更低，且规模越大效果越好，甚至在最大规模模型上实现对 forget 领域的显著计算开销下降，同时保持对齐。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑制能力多为事后干预，易被对手绕过。将抑制目标嵌入预训练阶段，提出一种可扩展、低成本的实现方式，通过数据级过滤来实现更稳健的能力约束。

Method: 设计以数据属性为基础的标签化方法：用稀疏自编码器标注 token，然后蒸馏出廉价高质量分类器。比较 token 过滤与文档过滤对 undesired capabilities 的抑制效果；评估跨两级规模的模型；分析对 benign 内容的影响；测试对噪声标签的鲁棒性；展示可在大模型中获得更高的成本效益比，且在 forget domain 上仍保持对齐。

Result: token 过滤在同等能力抑制下成本对 benign 内容更低；随着模型规模增大，过滤效果增强，largest 模型实现 7000x 的计算慢down 在 forget domain；token 过滤后仍可对 forget domain 对齐；提出了用于 token 标注的稀疏自编码器+低成本分类器的框架，且对噪声标签具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段的数据筛选是一种高效可扩展的抑制 undesired capabilities 的方法，token-level 过滤优于 document-level，并且在高规模模型中具有更显著的成本和效果收益，同时保留对指定负面领域的对齐能力，未来工作可聚焦提高过滤的精度、扩展到更多能力，以及降低对有益知识的影响。

Abstract: Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection severely undermines the continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation in deep learning is challenging: many methods are either computationally expensive or produce miscalibrated uncertainty. There is a need for a general, scalable uncertainty estimation method that works across data modalities including sequences.

Method: Introduce GRUBE, a BatchEnsemble-based GRU cell to enable sequential modeling with BatchEnsemble. Compare BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles on tabular and time-series tasks. Evaluate both predictive performance and uncertainty estimation, as well as model efficiency (parameters, training/inference time).

Result: BatchEnsemble achieves uncertainty estimation performance on par with deep ensembles and outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better predictive and uncertainty performance. Both methods use fewer parameters and offer faster training and inference than traditional ensembles.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble and its sequential extension GRUBE provide competitive uncertainty estimation with efficiency advantages, making them practical for both tabular and sequential data tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning models struggle with uncertainty estimation. Many approaches are either computationally infeasible or underestimate uncertainty. We investigate \textit{BatchEnsemble} as a general and scalable method for uncertainty estimation across both tabular and time series tasks. To extend BatchEnsemble to sequential modeling, we introduce GRUBE, a novel BatchEnsemble GRU cell. We compare the BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensemble models. Our results show that BatchEnsemble matches the uncertainty estimation performance of deep ensembles, and clearly outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better performance in both prediction and uncertainty estimation. These findings show that BatchEnsemble and GRUBE achieve similar performance with fewer parameters and reduced training and inference time compared to traditional ensembles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORDS introduces a continuous, invertible representation to predict variable-sized sets by mapping objects to a density and a feature field, enabling end-to-end field-space learning with exact decodability back to discrete sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many learning tasks involve predicting sets whose cardinality is unknown; padding or explicit size inference is inefficient or error-prone. A differentiable, invertible field-based representation can handle variable set sizes naturally.

Method: Define an invertible mapping from a discrete set to two continuous fields on a shared support: a density field that encodes object locations and counts, and a feature field that carries object attributes. Models operate in field space and can exactly decode back to the discrete set.

Result: Empirically evaluated on molecular generation/regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task of recovering local maxima, showing robust handling of unknown set sizes and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: CORDS provides a unified, invertible continuous representation for variable-sized sets, enabling end-to-end learning directly in field space with exact reconstruction to discrete sets, and is effective across diverse domains.

Abstract: Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neural networks adapt through first-order parameter updates, yet it remains unclear whether such updates preserve logical coherence. We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear. Since bilinearity is incompatible with negation, this forces the feature map to collapse. These results suggest that failures in knowledge editing, the reversal curse, and multi-hop reasoning may stem from common structural limitations inherent to the LPA.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出 T2：基于潜在表示的按样本自适应并行度估计，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本，以解决大规模并行思维中的超扩放诅咒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统级固定并行度对样本异质性不敏感，导致部分样本无需高并行度也能达到较好表现，从而产生资源浪费。

Method: 形式化 overscaling curse 的普遍性与触发机制，提出轻量级方法 T2，在解码前利用潜在表示预测每个样本的最优并行度 N'，再进行多路采样与聚合。

Result: 实验显示在保持可比性能的前提下显著降低成本，提高并行推理的效率。

Conclusion: overscaling curse 在实际中普遍存在，T2 提供简单有效的缓解思路，使多路并行推理更省成本。

Abstract: Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练过程并非无记忆，更新受优化器动量、数据次序、非凸性路径和辅助状态等因素影响，需要可跨模型/数据/场景的因果测量。

Method: 按来源、生命周期和可见性对机制进行分类；提出种子配对的函数空间因果 estimand；可移植扰动原语（携带/重置动量、Adam/EMA/BN、数据顺序窗口切换、队列/教师模型 Tweaks）；以及一个报告清单和审计工件（顺序哈希、缓冲区/BN 校验和、RNG 合约）。

Result: 给出一个可移植、因果、具有不确定性意识的测量协议，用以在不同模型、数据和训练 regime 中属性化训练历史的重要性。

Conclusion: 构建一个统一框架，帮助研究者在实验设计、复现实验、跨域比较时明确训练历史对结果的贡献，并促进可重复性与可解释性。

Abstract: Modern deep-learning training is not memoryless. Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE在时间序列中的token级路由忽视了时间局部性与连续性，难以充分建模长时依赖；需要引入与时间序列结构对齐的分段路由以提升效果与效率。

Method: 提出Seg-MoE层，按连续时间步将输入分段，允许每个专家在段内建模交互；将Seg-MoE嵌入时间序列Transformer；在多变量长期预测基准上进行对比和消融研究。

Result: Seg-MoE在几乎所有预测 horizon 上实现SOTA准确度，超过密集Transformer与此前的token级MoE；消融显示段级路由是性能提升的关键因素。

Conclusion: 将MoE路由粒度与时间序列的内在结构对齐，提供强大的条件稀疏性诱导偏置，为序列数据建模中的条件稀疏架构开启新方向。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently made significant advances in accurate time-series forecasting, but even these architectures struggle to scale efficiently while capturing long-term temporal dynamics. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) 取代任务导向学习（TCL），通过四单元的 Repository-Centric Experience 将静态代码库转化为互动学习信号，训练出 repo 特化型专家 SWE-Spot-4B，打破规模趋势，在多项 SWE 任务上超过开源模型并与效率导向的商业模型比肩，同时具备更高的训练样本效率和更低的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源小型语言模型在隐私敏感、资源受限环境下，难以对不熟悉的代码库实现推理时的强泛化。以任务为中心的学习（TCL）通过横向扩展对多仓库进行暴露，但未能解决对目标软件环境的深度理解（“环境物理”）问题。需要通过参数化知识获取来内化环境特性，而非在推理阶段通过高成本检索来弥补。

Method: 提出 Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) 范式，强调在垂直的仓库深度上进行学习，而非横向的任务广度。设计四单元的 Repository-Centric Experience，将静态代码库转化为交互学习信号，训练出 SWE-Spot-4B 家族的 repo 专门化专家模型，以参数化方式掌握目标环境的“物理”与约束。

Result: 在多项 SWE 任务上，SWE-Spot-4B 相比同等规模及以下的开源模型表现更优，甚至超越更大模型（如 CWM by Meta、Qwen3-Coder-30B）。并且在与效率导向的商业模型（如 GPT-4.1-mini、GPT-5-nano）比较时，达到或接近其性能，同时具备更高的训练样本效率和更低的推理成本。

Conclusion: 仓库掌握（repository mastery）是构建高效智能的一个独立且必要的维度，补充通用编码能力。RCL 提供了一种可在受限环境中实现强泛化和高效推理的新路径，强调面向仓库的深度学习信号对实际编程任务的重要性。

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabClustPFN introduces a prior-fitted network for clustering tabular data that amortizes Bayesian inference over cluster assignments and cluster cardinality, trained on synthetic data, enabling single-pass clustering of unseen datasets without retraining, and handling mixed feature types with robustness across structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering tabular data is hard due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the lack of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Unsupervised clustering requires permutation-invariant outputs and infers the number of clusters.

Method: Train a prior-fitted network on synthetic data drawn from a flexible clustering prior to perform amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. At test time, cluster unseen datasets in a single forward pass without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning, handling heterogeneous numerical and categorical features.

Result: TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines on synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, showing strong robustness in exploratory settings.

Conclusion: PFN-based clustering can generalize to unsupervised tabular clustering, inferring both cluster assignments and the number of clusters, while handling mixed feature types; code is released for reproduction.

Abstract: Clustering tabular data is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to heterogeneous feature types, diverse data-generating mechanisms, and the absence of transferable inductive biases across datasets. Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning. The model naturally handles heterogeneous numerical and categorical features and adapts to a wide range of clustering structures. Experiments on synthetic data and curated real-world tabular benchmarks show that TabClustPFN outperforms classical, deep, and amortized clustering baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness in out-of-the-box exploratory settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically deterministic in nature and lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's lack of knowledge or ignorance of its own representations. We theoretically motivate negative log-density of an embedding as a proxy for the epistemic uncertainty, where low-density regions signify model ignorance. The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching. We empirically demonstrate that REPVLM achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Beyond classification, we also demonstrate that the model also provides a scalable metric for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SENDAI uses a hierarchical sparse-measurement data assimilation framework to reconstruct full spatial fields from hyper-sparse sensor observations by merging simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections, achieving large SSIM gains on MODIS vegetation indices across six global sites under seasonal-domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment, especially under distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from training data; need lightweight, sparse-measurement reconstruction for physically grounded inference.

Method: A hierarchical framework that combines simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections to reconstruct full spatial states from hyper-sparse sensor observations. Evaluated on satellite remote sensing (MODIS vegetation indices) across six sites; uses seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift to test robustness.

Result: Outperforms established baselines requiring denser observations, with up to 185% SSIM improvement over traditional baselines and 36% over recent high-frequency-based methods. Gains are pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics, and the method preserves diagnostically relevant structures such as field topologies, land-cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients.

Conclusion: SENDAI offers a lightweight, operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor/control, enabling better downstream inference from sparsely observed data.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

<details>

Motivation: 许多强化学习问题存在多个高质量解，但标准的期望回报优化往往导致输出集中在少数结果上。这种模式坍塌不仅仅由探索不足或正则化弱引起，而是期望回报目标的结构性后果。

Method: 理论分析学习动力学，发现结果之间的对数概率比随奖励差线性演化，导致概率比指数级分化并必然崩塌；将造成崩塌的概率乘子移除的最小修正：逆概率缩放（IPS），从学习信号中消除结果频率放大效应；在 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 框架内实现 IPS-GRPO，作为无额外模型的直接替换。

Result: 在推理与分子生成等任务上，IPS-GRPO 显著降低了结果层面的模式崩塌，同时保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 纠正目标本身的缺陷比简单增加探索或正则化更关键，IPS-GRPO 提供一个可落地的修正思路，促进多模态策略优化的鲁棒性与可靠性。

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/qisongxiao/LLM4Fluid.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XFactors: a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and controls a chosen set of factors via a residual subspace and factor-specific subspaces, using contrastive supervision (InfoNCE) and KL regularization to achieve state-of-the-art disentanglement with scalable latent capacity, demonstrated on CelebA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised methods fail on real data without strong inductive biases; supervised methods are unstable and hard to scale; need scalable weak supervision that yields explicit control over factors.

Method: Decompose latent into S and T_i; encode each factor in its T_i with InfoNCE loss to pull together same-factor latents and push apart different-factor latents; apply KL regularization to enforce Gaussian structure on S and aggregated T_i to avoid extra supervision for non-targeted factors and avoid adversarial training.

Result: Consistent state-of-the-art disentanglement scores across multiple datasets with constant hyperparameters; qualitative factor alignment in subspaces; enable factor swapping via latent replacement; scales with latent capacity; validated on CelebA.

Conclusion: XFactors provides a scalable, weakly-supervised disentanglement framework with explicit factor control, avoiding adversarial training and classifiers, demonstrated effectiveness on real-world data like CelebA.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.
  We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\mathcal{T}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.
  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

Abstract: Model merging efficiently aggregates capabilities from multiple fine-tuned models into a single one, operating purely in parameter space without original data or expensive re-computation. Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同排序（curricula）是否改变学习轨迹，还是仅改变同一轨迹内的数据暴露，以便更高效地设计预训练策略。

Method: 在14M–410M参数的Pythia模型上进行300B token的训练，比较三种语言学启发的课程（年龄获取AoA、词频、动词变异VV）与随机排序；在1B参数时也比较随机与VV；分析梯度噪声、输出头谱饱和、收敛等现象，并给出基于梯度方差控制的理想化分析。

Result: 在所有排序中，训练遵循一个共享的潜在阶段序列；课程主要改变的是“同阶段的数据暴露”而非产生新阶段；较小模型中，随机排序具有更高梯度噪声和更强的晚期输出头谱饱和，且最终准确度更低；课程在等计算下减小了这些问题；在更大规模下，饱和差异和课程收益下降；提出难度节奏与优化稳定性的联系的理想化分析；实用结论：课程通过稳定同阶段优化来带来收益。

Conclusion: 课程帮助在同阶段的内部优化稳定性上产生益处，而非创造新的学习阶段；在小模型上收益明显，规模增大后收益减弱；设计课程时应关注如何在相位内分配难度。

Abstract: Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.

Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线模仿学习中，BC 在专家示例受限时表现不佳。引入 PIDM 的动机是通过结合未来状态预测与 IDM，提升稳定性和样本效率。理论需要解释为何这类结构能带来改进。

Method: 对 PIDM 的偏差-方差权衡进行理论分析，给出未来状态预测的偏差对总误差的影响，以及把 IDM 条件化在预测上的方差降低效应，推导在何种预测偏差条件下 PIDM 相对 BC 更具优势；并通过二维导航与高维3D环境的实验进行验证。

Conclusion: 在满足特定预测偏差条件下，PIDM 能通过减少方差来获得更低的总体误差与更高的样本效率；理论分析与实验结果相符，表明 PIDM 在数据受限场景下相较 BC 更具优势，且引入额外数据源时优势更明显。

Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a practical offline imitation learning method, but it often fails when expert demonstrations are limited. Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\% more samples than PIDM.

TL;DR: 提出一种 interpretable 框架，通过解耦注意力从预训练 PFN 中实现光谱发现，输出显式的谱密度和基于 Bochner 的平稳核，推断快速且精度与 PFN/基线相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFN 能实现高效的前向-推断 (amortized inference)，但缺乏对学习到的先验和核函数的透明性，难以直接用于需要显式协方差模型的下游任务。

Method: 通过对训练好的 PFN 进行机制分析，识别注意力潜在输出作为关键中介，将 PFN 潜在变量映射到谱密度估计，并利用 Bochner 的定理构造相应的平稳核；在单样本与多样本情形下研究谱 identifiability 的理论界限，并给出在多份函数样本存在时的一致性证明。

Result: 解码器能够恢复多峰谱混合，给出显式谱密度与平稳核，支持高斯过程回归，精度与 PFN 及优化基线相当，同时仅需一次前向传播，较优化基线实现了数量级上的推断加速。

Conclusion: 提供可解释的 PFN 谱先验，使下游任务能使用显式协方差模型，并在保持准确度的前提下显著提升推断效率。

Abstract: Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) enable efficient amortized inference but lack transparent access to their learned priors and kernels. This opacity hinders their use in downstream tasks, such as surrogate-based optimization, that require explicit covariance models. We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

Motivation: 深度学习在早期预测败血症方面有高性能但缺乏可解释性，且往往忽略潜在亚表型，需要一种可解释且能揭示患者亚群的建模方法。

Method: 将时间序列的EMR数据表示为关系数据模式，应用 propositionalisation（基于聚合/选择函数）将数据扁平化为可解释特征；使用选择性朴素贝叶斯分类器进行预测；提供单变量、全局、局部和反事实等四维解释。

Conclusion: 提出的关系型可解释框架为早期Sepsis预测提供新路径，尤其有助于识别潜在亚表型，具有较好的临床可解释性与应用潜力。

Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

Abstract: Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of encrypted network traffic, effective traffic classification has become essential for network security and quality of service management. Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.

Conclusion: KVW 是一种训练无关、高效的去学习方法，适用于 LVLMs，降低计算资源需求，同时维持所需的忘记效果。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Abstract: Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable method to approximate the kernel of the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA). For this, we use a surrogate deep neural network (DNN) that learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This avoids the need to compute large Jacobians. Training relies solely on efficient Jacobian-vector products, allowing to compute predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs. Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Abstract: Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

Abstract: Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions.

Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

Abstract: Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

Abstract: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning is often \emph{nonstationary}: rewards and dynamics drift, accelerate, oscillate, and trigger abrupt switches in the optimal action. Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \emph{how much} the environment changes, not \emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length--curvature--kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly. Experiments show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.

Abstract: Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.

Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

Abstract: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.

Abstract: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

Abstract: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

Abstract: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

Abstract: The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.

Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.

*Youguang Chen,George Biros*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Latent-IMH is a Metropolis-Hastings independence sampler for Bayesian linear inverse problems with an expensive forward operator A. It uses a cheap surrogate Ã to generate latent variables and then refines them with the exact A. This offline-precomputation approach can yield large computational speedups, sometimes orders of magnitude, over state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Bayesian linear inverse problems, costly forward operators A impede posterior sampling. If A can be factored to produce a cheap surrogate Ã, one can move substantial computation offline to build efficient proposals and accelerators for MCMC methods.

Method: Construct a surrogate forward operator Ã from A via beneficial factorizations. Latent-IMH generates intermediate latent variables from the approximate model and then refines them using the exact A within a Metropolis-Hastings independence sampler. The expensive computations are shifted to an offline phase, and the analysis uses KL divergence and mixing-time bounds.

Result: The paper provides theoretical performance guarantees (via KL divergence and mixing-time analysis) and empirical evidence on several model problems. Latent-IMH outperforms No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency under reasonable assumptions, with potential speedups up to orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Latent-IMH is an effective, cost-saving sampling method for expensive forward operators in Bayesian linear inverse problems, achieving substantial speedups by moving the bulk of computation offline.

Abstract: We study sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian linear inverse problems where $A$, the parameters to observables operator, is computationally expensive. In many applications, $A$ can be factored in a manner that facilitates the construction of a cost-effective approximation $\tilde{A}$. In this framework, we introduce Latent-IMH, a sampling method based on the Metropolis-Hastings independence (IMH) sampler. Latent-IMH first generates intermediate latent variables using the approximate $\tilde{A}$, and then refines them using the exact $A$. Its primary benefit is that it shifts the computational cost to an offline phase. We theoretically analyze the performance of Latent-IMH using KL divergence and mixing time bounds. Using numerical experiments on several model problems, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency. In some cases, Latent-IMH can be orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes.

Abstract: Learning causal structures from observational data remains a fundamental yet computationally intensive task, particularly in high-dimensional settings where existing methods face challenges such as the super-exponential growth of the search space and increasing computational demands. To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of VISTA, yielding notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of base learners.

Conclusion: DiffCLF 为 EBM 提供了一种高效且不易陷入模式盲点的训练方案，扩展了 EBMs 的应用范围并提升了性能。

Abstract: Score-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable success. While they are usually parameterized by the score, an alternative way is to use a series of time-dependent energy-based models (EBMs), where the score is obtained from the negative input-gradient of the energy. Crucially, EBMs can be leveraged not only for generation, but also for tasks such as compositional sampling or building Boltzmann Generators via Monte Carlo methods. However, training EBMs remains challenging. Direct maximum likelihood is computationally prohibitive due to the need for nested sampling, while score matching, though efficient, suffers from mode blindness. To address these issues, we introduce the Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) objective, a simple method that avoids blindness while remaining computationally efficient. DiffCLF reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, and can be seamlessly combined with standard score-based objectives. We validate the effectiveness of DiffCLF by comparing the estimated energies against ground truth in analytical Gaussian mixture cases, and by applying the trained models to tasks such as model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling. Our results show that DiffCLF enables EBMs with higher fidelity and broader applicability than existing approaches.

Result: 即使在理想的 DM 情况下，单纯使用一阶随机去噪核的积分也会系统性失败；但若引入二阶去噪核且具备协方差信息，性能显著提升。引入基于一阶传输映射的确定性 aMC 积分在高计算成本下优于随机的一阶方案。另一方面，在学习型 DM 条件下，所有 DM-aMC 变体均难以产生准确的 BG，主要瓶颈在于对数密度估计不准确，限制了整体采样质量。

Conclusion: DM-aMC 在理论上通过中间密度桥接目标与参考分布具有潜力；但要在学习型 DM 下达到稳健的无偏采样，需要解决对数密度估计的不准确问题，并在效率与准确性之间寻求更优的折中，可能的方向包括改进 DM 的密度估计、发展更高阶或确定性的 aMC 积分策略，以及结合更强的协方差信息的采样更新策略。

Abstract: Sampling configurations at thermodynamic equilibrium is a central challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) tackle it by combining a generative model with a Monte Carlo (MC) correction step to obtain asymptotically unbiased samples from an unnormalized target. Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost. Finally, in the learned-DM setting, all DM-aMC variants struggle to produce accurate BGs; we trace the main bottleneck to inaccurate DM log-density estimation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method called the Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine based on the Gabriel edited set for the computation of the probability of failure for a complex system as determined by a threshold condition on a computer model of system behavior. The method is designed to minimize the number of evaluations of the computer model while preserving the geometry of the decision boundary that determines the probability. It employs an adaptive sampling strategy designed to strategically allocate points near the boundary determining failure and builds a locally linear surrogate boundary that remains consistent with its geometry by strategic clustering of training points. We prove two convergence results and we compare the performance of the method against a number of state of the art classification methods on four test problems. We also apply the method to determine the probability of survival using the Lotka--Volterra model for competing species.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models generate conditional samples by augmenting the reverse-time score with the gradient of a learned classifier, yet it remains unclear whether standard classifier training procedures yield effective diffusion guidance. We address this gap by showing that, under mild smoothness assumptions on the classifiers, controlling the cross-entropy error at each diffusion step also controls the error of the resulting guidance vectors: classifiers achieving conditional KL divergence $\varepsilon^2$ from the ground-truth conditional label probabilities induce guidance vectors with mean squared error $\widetilde{O}(d \varepsilon )$. Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error under classifier guidance and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev-type inequality. Moreover, we show that the classifier smoothness assumption is essential, by constructing simple counterexamples demonstrating that, without it, control of the guidance vector can fail for almost all distributions. To our knowledge, our work establishes the first quantitative link between classifier training and guidance alignment, yielding both a theoretical foundation for classifier guidance and principled guidelines for classifier selection.

Abstract: We introduce a flexible empirical Bayes approach for fitting Bayesian generalized linear models. Specifically, we adopt a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method and the prior is estimated within the VI algorithm, making the method tuning-free. Unlike traditional VI methods that optimize the posterior density function, our approach directly optimizes the posterior mean and prior parameters. This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions. We apply the framework to solve sparse logistic regression and demonstrate the superior predictive performance of our method in extensive numerical studies, by comparing it to prevalent sparse logistic regression approaches.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) minimises the worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set that can capture distributional shifts in out-of-sample environments. While Huber (linear-vacuous) contamination is a classical minimal-assumption model for an $\varepsilon$-fraction of arbitrary perturbations, including it in an ambiguity set can make the worst-case risk infinite and the DRO objective vacuous unless one imposes strong boundedness or support assumptions. We address these challenges by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets: we learn a high-mass bulk set from data while considering contamination inside the bulk and bounding the remaining tail contribution separately. This leads to a closed-form, finite $\mathrm{mean}+\sup$ robust objective and tractable linear or second-order cone programs for common losses and bulk geometries. Through this framework, we highlight and exploit the equivalence between the imprecise probability (IP) notion of upper expectation and the worst-case risk, demonstrating how IP credal sets translate into DRO objectives with interpretable tolerance levels. Experiments on heavy-tailed inventory control, geographically shifted house-price regression, and demographically shifted text classification show competitive robustness-accuracy trade-offs and efficient optimisation times, using Bayesian, frequentist, or empirical reference distributions.

Motivation: 现有方法要么将LLM指导作为未经验证的启发式，易受LLM幻觉影响；要么将语义信息嵌入单一学习器，缺乏灵活性与鲁棒性。需要一个可扩展、鲁棒且对LLM指导自动下调影响的框架。

Method: 采用守卫式（guardrailed）集成架构，将LLM派生的特征先验嵌入到线性与非线性基学习器的集合中，通过交叉验证自适应地校准各学习器的权重，以实现对任意凸组合的对等或更优表现（理论上具备oracle-style保证）。

Conclusion: Statsformer 提供了一个灵活且鲁棒的框架，兼具扩展性与对LLM导入的保护机制，在存在潜在幻觉风险时仍能维持甚至提升预测性能。

Abstract: We introduce Statsformer, a principled framework for integrating large language model (LLM)-derived knowledge into supervised statistical learning. Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has become a cornerstone of distribution-free uncertainty quantification, conventionally evaluated by its coverage and interval length. This work critically examines the sufficiency of these standard metrics. We demonstrate that the interval length might be deceptively improved through a counter-intuitive approach termed Prejudicial Trick (PT), while the coverage remains valid. Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric interval stability which helps detect whether a new CP method implicitly improves the length based on such PT-like techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.

Abstract: We introduce the use of latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorial distributions, as a tool for learning generative models of discrete data. The low-dimensional latent space encodes statistical dependencies and removes redundant degrees of freedom among the categorial variables. We equip the parameter domain with a Riemannian geometry such that the spaces and distances are related by isometries which enables consistent flow matching. In particular, geodesics become straight lines which makes model training by flow matching effective. Empirical results demonstrate that reduced latent dimensions suffice to represent data for generative modeling.

Abstract: Understanding the stability and long-time behavior of generative models is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning. This paper provides quantitative bounds on the sampling error of score-based generative models by leveraging stability and forgetting properties of the Markov chain associated with the reverse-time dynamics. Under weak assumptions, we provide the two structural properties to ensure the propagation of initialization and discretization errors of the backward process: a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition. A practical consequence is quantitative stability of the sampling procedure, as the reverse diffusion dynamics induces a contraction mechanism along the sampling trajectory. Our results clarify the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and provide a principled framework for analyzing propagation of errors in such approaches.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various domains but understanding the precise token dynamics remains a theoretical challenge. Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.

Abstract: We develop a diffusion-based sampler for target distributions known up to a normalising constant. To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees. We tackle the score estimation problem by developing an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler that evolves auxiliary variables from conditional distributions along the path, which provides principled score estimates for time-varying distributions. We further develop novel control variate schedules that minimise the variance of these score estimates. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We develop a near-optimal testing procedure under the framework of Gaussian differential privacy for simple as well as one- and two-sided tests under monotone likelihood ratio conditions. Our mechanism is based on a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds, whose population risk matches the private minimax rate up to logarithmic factors. Using this estimator, we construct private test statistics that achieve the same asymptotic relative efficiency as the non-private, most powerful tests while maintaining conservative type I error control. In addition to our theoretical results, our numerical experiments show that our private tests outperform competing DP methods and offer comparable power to the non-private most powerful tests, even at moderately small sample sizes and privacy loss budgets.
