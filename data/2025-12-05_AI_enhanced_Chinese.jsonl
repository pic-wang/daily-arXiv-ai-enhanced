However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A.

It leverages information from labelled samples, whose acquisition is often costly or labour-intensive, together with unlabelled data to enhance prediction performance. This defines an incomplete-data problem, which statistically can be formulated within the likelihood framework for finite mixture models that can be fitted using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Ideally, one would prefer a completely labelled sample, as one would anticipate that a labelled observation provides more information than an unlabelled one. However, when the mechanism governing label absence depends on the observed features or the class labels or both, the missingness indicators themselves contain useful information. In certain situations, the information gained from modelling the missing-label mechanism can even outweigh the loss due to missing labels, yielding a classifier with a smaller expected error than one based on a completely labelled sample analysed.

We demonstrate a deep conditional-generative machine learning approach for the modelling of realistic activity schedules depending on input labels such as an individual's age, employment status, or other information relevant to their scheduling. We combine (i) a structured latent generative approach, with (ii) a conditional approach, through a novel Conditional VAE architecture. This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels.

CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables.\n  The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference.\n  The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions.

Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training.

Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD. Finally, inspired by our findings in the case of linear regression, we consider widespread LLMs augmented with initial guess capabilities, and show that their performance is improved on a semantic similarity task.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c06\u6c42\u89e3\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u5728 RL \u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5c31\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u662f\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5148\u5bf9 Transformer \u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) \u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6392\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3e\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u91cf\u7eb2\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u5143\u683c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u6700\u4f73\u6df7\u5408\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc RL \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671d\u5411\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002"}}

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit.

Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDRL\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411KL\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u4e14\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u591a\u6837\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u7684 RL \u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DDRL\uff09\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06 RL \u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u504f\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDDRL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3 baselines \u7684\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc7\u767e\u4e07\u5c0f\u65f6GPU\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e00\u4e07\u6b21\u53cc\u76f2\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DDRL\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u878d\u5408 RL \u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6STeP-Diff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DeepONet\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5229\u7528DeepONet\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u5ea7\u57ce\u5e02\u300114\u5929\u300159\u53f0\u81ea\u7814\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cSTeP-Diff\u5728MAE\u3001RMSE\u3001MAPE\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u6700\u592789.12%\u300182.30%\u300125.00%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes a context-aware MoE system that uses CXL-NDP offload and per-expert mixed-precision quantization to keep hot experts in GPU while offloading others, achieving significant throughput gains with minimal accuracy loss.", "motivation": "MoE models grow in parameter count so large that expert weights exceed GPU memory, causing costly parameter movement when offloading to external memory.

However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u539f\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6PSCA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u4ea4\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u57df\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8c\u503c\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8ffd\u6c42\u6837\u672c\u4e24\u4e24\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7ec4\u6b63\u4ea4\u539f\u578b\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u7c7b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7c7b\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u7c7b\u5185\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u8fd1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u793a\u5bf9\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6210\u5458\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u539f\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cf\u5316\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e92\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u57df\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PSCA\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7c7b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0cPSCA\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8fde\u63a5\u3002"}}

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization.

To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones.

Existing fine-tuning methods for diffusion models significantly suffer from reward over-optimization, resulting in high-reward but unnatural samples and degraded diversity. To mitigate over-optimization, we propose \\textbf{Soft Q-based Diffusion Finetuning (SQDF)}, a novel KL-regularized RL method for diffusion alignment that applies a reparameterized policy gradient of a training-free, differentiable estimation of the soft Q-function. SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment.

Yet, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks makes it challenging to evaluate, compare, and further develop these ML models meaningfully. In this work, we introduce LeMat-GenBench, a unified benchmark for generative models of crystalline materials, supported by a set of evaluation metrics designed to better inform model development and downstream applications.

Existing approaches, such as SCONE, achieve robustness to covariate and semantic shifts but assume static environments, leading to degraded performance in dynamic domains. In this paper, we propose Temp-SCONE, a temporally consistent extension of SCONE designed to handle temporal shifts in dynamic environments. Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization. Our theoretical insights on temporal stability and generalization error further establish Temp-SCONE as a step toward reliable OWL in evolving dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case.

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5951\u7ea6\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08EO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6OSAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u5951\u7ea6\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u670d\u52a1\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5951\u7ea6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u8c03\u63a7\u53c2\u6570alpha\u4e0elambda_C\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684EO\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u8db3\u591f\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u670d\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faObserv ed Service Agreement Graph\uff08OSAG\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\uff1a\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u7684\u5951\u7ea6\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u533a\u57df\u3001\u7a00\u6709\u4f5c\u7269\u6307\u6807\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5951\u7ea6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u670d\u52a1\u4efd\u989d\uff1b\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u76d1\u63a7\u5951\u7ea6\u5c42\u66dd\u5149\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5951\u7ea6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u4f7f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u679a\u63a7\u5236\u94ae(alpha, lambda_C)\u66b4\u9732\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6cbb\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u7ed9\u51fa toy \u573a\u666f\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aOSAG\u91c7\u6837\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5951\u7ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7c97\u7ec6\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u805a\u7126\u4e8eAVIRIS\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff08Indian Pines \u4e0e Salinas\uff09\u4ee5\u53caSentinel-2 EuroSAT\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eOSAG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5148\u8986\u76d6\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u7c97-\u7ec6\u5951\u7ea6 ablation\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u7ec6\u7684\u5951\u7ea6\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "OSAG\u4f7f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5951\u7ea6\u5904\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u63a7\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5951\u7ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\uff08\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5728 EuroSAT \u7684\u7c97-\u7ec6\u5951\u7ea6\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u66f4\u7ec6\u7684\u5951\u7ea6\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u6cbb\u7406\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5373\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5951\u7ea6\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0cOSAG\u4e3aEO\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u5951\u7ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6cbb\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u3002"}}

This requires models that can represent the influence of local site conditions on ground motion characteristics. In this context, data driven approaches that learn site controlled signatures from recorded ground motions offer a promising direction. We address strong ground motion generation from time-domain accelerometer records and introduce the TimesNet-Gen, a time-domain conditional generator. The approach uses a station specific latent bottleneck. We evaluate generation by comparing HVSR curves and fundamental site-frequency $f_0$ distributions between real and generated records per station, and summarize station specificity with a score based on the $f_0$ distribution confusion matrices. TimesNet-Gen achieves strong station-wise alignment and compares favorably with a spectrogram-based conditional VAE baseline for site-specific strong motion synthesis.

Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Trinity\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LLMs\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\uff08Thinker/Worker/Verifier\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u8f6e\u5206\u5de5\uff0c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7ea60.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b+\u7ea610K\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u826f\u597dOOD\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u7684SOTA\u8868\u73b0\uff08LiveCodeBench 86.2%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001API\u5c01\u95ed\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6df7\u5408\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u9690\u85cf\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u7531\u7ea60.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7d27\u51d1LM\u548c\u7ea610K\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565 CMA-ES\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u591a\u8f6e\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u4e3a\u9009\u5b9a\u7684LLM\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\uff08Thinker/Worker/Verifier\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5916\u5305\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "Trinity\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9OOD\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5728LiveCodeBench\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f9786.2%\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\uff1a1\uff09\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u5883\uff0c2\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7684 CMA-ES \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5757-\u03b5\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6781\u7b80\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u5408\u9690\u85cf\u6001\u8bed\u5883\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Core methodological topics include loss-function design, parameter-estimation principles, ordinary least squares, gradient-based optimization algorithms and their variants, as well as regularization techniques such as Ridge and LASSO regression. Through detailed mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and intuitive visual explanations, the materials help students understand not only how regression models are constructed and optimized, but also how they reveal the underlying relationships between features and response variables.

The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works.

In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemLoRA \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1bMemLoRA-V \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u672c\u5730\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u672c\u5730\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff1bMemLoRA \u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u672c\u5730\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0cMemLoRA-V \u96c6\u6210\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMemLoRA \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc710\u500d\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 Gemma2-27B\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8fbe\u523060\u500d\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 GPT-OSS-120B\uff09\u5728 LoCoMo \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cVLM \u96c6\u6210\u7684 MemLoRA-V \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0881.3 vs 23.7\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u52b2\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u5730\u8bb0\u5fc6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u4e91\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u5b58\u50a8-\u68c0\u7d22-\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input.

While existing neural operators (NOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations, they remain limited in practice due to poor scalability on dense grids, error accumulation during dynamic unrolling, and task-specific design. ECHO addresses these challenges through three key innovations. (i) It employs a hierarchical convolutional encode-decode architecture that achieves a 100 $\\times$ spatio-temporal compression while preserving fidelity on mesh points. (ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation.

Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows.

They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector. Our approach can be used to bound the sample complexity for minimizing both the validation loss as well as the number of gradient descent iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans.

In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa VGG-Flow\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e24\u5168\u5176\u7f8e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e4b\u5dee\u5e94\u4e0e\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u5b9e\u73b0\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u878d\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b Stable Diffusion 3 \u4e0a\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e14\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
