### [1] [Federated Learning with Gramian Angular Fields for Privacy-Preserving ECG Classification on Heterogeneous IoT Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03753)
*Youssef Elmir,Yassine Himeur,Abbes Amira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning framework using Gramian Angular Field (GAF) to convert 1D ECG signals into 2D images for CNN-based classification, tested on heterogeneous IoT devices (server, laptop, Raspberry Pi 4). It achieves high privacy-preserving edge learning with 95.18% accuracy in multi-client setup and better performance than a single-client baseline, while maintaining reasonable communication and computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for privacy-preserving ECG classification in IoT healthcare. Centralized data collection poses privacy risks and may not handle heterogeneity across edge devices. The study aims to enable secure, scalable edge learning using FL and GAF-based image representations.

Method: Transform 1D ECG into 2D GAF images, apply CNNs for feature extraction, and train via federated learning across multiple devices (server, laptop, Raspberry Pi 4). Evaluate on heterogeneous hardware to assess accuracy, training time, and communication efficiency.

Result: FL-GAF achieves 95.18% accuracy in a multi-client setup, outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. GAF transformation adds computation but remains efficient in resource use and communication overhead across devices.

Conclusion: GAF-based federated ECG classification is a promising privacy-preserving and scalable approach for IoT healthcare, demonstrating feasibility across heterogeneous edge devices and potential for efficient edge deployments.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

### [3] [Contamination Detection for VLMs using Multi-Modal Semantic Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03774)
*Jaden Park,Mu Cai,Feng Yao,Jingbo Shang,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态语义扰动的检测方法，用于识别被污染的视觉-语言模型，且对多种污染策略具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因互联网规模的预训练语料可能泄露测试集，导致污染模型在基准上表现夸大；现有检测多集中在数据或模型层面的修复，缺乏对污染模型的检测手段。

Method: 在开源VLM上有意对常用基准进行污染；提出一种简单而有效的检测框架，基于多模态语义扰动，观察污染模型在受控扰动下的泛化能力变化；在多种现实污染策略下验证方法的稳健性。

Result: 现有检测方法要么失败、要么表现不稳定；所提出的方法对污染模型表现出鲁棒的检测能力，能在不同污染策略下有效识别。

Conclusion: 方法简单且有效，具备实用性；将公开代码和扰动数据集，以促进对污染VLM的检测与评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

### [4] [FusionDP: Foundation Model-Assisted Differentially Private Learning for Partially Sensitive Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03806)
*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP通过先利用大型基础模型对敏感特征进行在不直接访问真值的前提下的推断/代替，结合修改后的DP-SGD实现特征级隐私保护，从而在对敏感特征隐私保护的同时提升模型在分子级别的任务（ICU相关的 tabular 数据与临床笔记分类）上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实情景中，往往只需对一部分特征进行隐私保护。对所有特征执行DP-SGD会带来过多噪声，严重损害效用。提出一个特征级隐私保护框架，利用外部先验（基础模型的推断）提升敏感特征的可用性，同时严格保护原始敏感特征的隐私。

Method: 分两步：第一步，利用大型基础模型在不访问真实敏感特征值的前提下，根据非敏感特征推断/代替敏感特征（充当高质量的先验），用于训练时的辅助信息。第二步，提出改良的DP-SGD算法，在同时使用原始特征和推断特征训练模型的同时，正式保护原始敏感特征的隐私。实验在PhysioNet的分割性败症预测（表格数据）和MIMIC-III临床文本分类上进行。

Result: 与隐私保护基线相比，FusionDP在几个任务上显著提升模型性能，同时保持对敏感特征的特征级隐私保护。实验结果表明，基于基础模型的推断可以在不直接暴露真实值的情况下提高隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: FusionDP证明了通过特征级DP结合Foundation模型驱动的特征推断可以在多模态任务中提升隐私保护下的模型效用，为不同数据模态的隐私保护提供新的研究方向。

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

TL;DR: A routing approach assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it, achieving compute savings without loss of accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models are accurate but expensive to run. There is a need to deploy cost-efficiently by matching problem difficulty to appropriately sized models.

Method: Use intermediate representations from s1.1-32B to train lightweight predictors of problem difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning models, routing each problem to the smallest capable model.

Result: On diverse math benchmarks, routing is more efficient than random assignment and matches the performance of s1.1-32B while using significantly less compute.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing is an effective strategy for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在 GNN 中引入 Sketched Random Features 全局嵌入，解决长程信息传递中的错位、节点表征过平滑和表达能力不足，提升性能；可作为独立策略或与位置编码等方法互补，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN 的局部消息传递在利用图稀疏性和强诱导偏置方面有效，但存在三大挑战：(i) 长程信息的 oversquashing；(ii) 节点表征的 oversmoothing；(iii) 表达能力受限。需要一种高效的全局、距离敏感且与拓扑无关的嵌入来补充局部聚合。

Method: 引入 Sketched Random Features（随机特征的压缩全局嵌入）到标准 GNN 结构中。嵌入具有唯一性、距离敏感性和拓扑无关性，能够提升跨远距离的信息传递能力。理论分析与实证实验均表明它缓解前述三大挑战。

Result: 在真实图任务上，与基线 GNN 相比表现显著提升；既可作为独立解决方案，也可作为对现有技术（如图位置编码）的互补增强；代码公开在 GitHub。

Conclusion: 通过将全局、距离敏感的随机嵌入注入到 GNN，显著缓解 oversquashing、oversmoothing 与表达力受限问题，提升性能，提供一个高效且可组合的方案来捕捉长程依赖。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了 StratDiff，一种基于扩散模型和能量函数的离线到在线强化学习的分层采样方法，通过对每个样本计算 KL 散度来将训练批次分成离线-样本与在线-样本，分别采用离线和在线目标，提升在 D4RL 上的稳定性与适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线数据中的行为策略与在线学习中不断演进的策略之间存在分布偏移，且现有方法未充分利用离线数据的分布结构来自适应不同样本的学习策略，缺乏对离线数据内在分布特征的显式评估与利用。

Method: 提出 StratDiff：先用扩散模型从离线数据中学习先验知识，再通过能量函数对其进行 refinement，以提升仿真行为与离线样本的一致性并在在线微调阶段生成离线风格的动作；对每个样本计算生成动作与采样动作的 KL 散度，并据此将训练批次分层为离线-样本与在线-样本，离线-样本使用离线目标，在线-样本使用在线学习策略。将 StratDiff 与 Cal-QL、IQL 结合，在 D4RL 基准上进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果显示 StratDiff 与现有方法相比具显著提升，具有更高的适应性和更稳定的性能，尤其在离线到在线的转变阶段表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过利用离线数据的分布结构并对样本进行分层训练，StratDiff 提供了一种更为稳健的离线到在线 RL 转换方案，能更好地平滑策略的在线演变并提升整体表现。

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、医疗等高风险领域，决策树的可解释性很重要，但获取大规模高质量的预训练数据成本高且直接训练最优树计算成本高，因此需要高效的合成数据方法来支撑元学习。

Method: 通过对近似最优的决策树进行合成采样，生成大规模、接近真实分布的训练数据集；使用 MetaTree Transformer 进行元学习；并与使用真实数据预训练或昂贵的最优树基线进行对比。

Result: 在实验中，方法实现的性能与使用真实数据预训练或昂贵的最优树基线相当；显著降低计算成本；提高数据生成的灵活性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该策略为可解释决策树的元学习提供了一种可扩展、低成本的训练数据生成路径，推动其在高风险领域的规模化应用。

Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in high-stakes fields like finance and
healthcare due to their interpretability. This work introduces an efficient,
scalable method for generating synthetic pre-training data to enable
meta-learning of decision trees. Our approach samples near-optimal decision
trees synthetically, creating large-scale, realistic datasets. Using the
MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves
performance comparable to pre-training on real-world data or with
computationally expensive optimal decision trees. This strategy significantly
reduces computational costs, enhances data generation flexibility, and paves
the way for scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree
models.

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADQ 通过显式建模后继状态分布的转移模型来降低 DQN 的训练方差，同时保持无偏估值，提升稳定性和学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN 的目标更新往往来自历史策略产生的状态转移，信息可能不足且方差较大，且与当前策略对齐较差，从而降低学习信号质量。需要更稳定、与当前策略更一致的学习信号。

Method: 引入一个随机转移模型来显式建模后继状态分布，并将该后继状态信息整合到 Q 值估计中，同时提出更高效的基于转移结构的行动选择策略；给出理论保证，表明在保持无偏估值的前提下降低训练方差。

Result: 在标准强化学习基准和真实世界的向量控制任务中，SADQ 相较于 DQN 变体在稳定性和学习效率方面表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: SADQ 提出将后继状态信息纳入 Q 学习的新框架，提升样本效率与稳定性，具有较强的普适性与潜在扩展性。

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出 Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) 概念并建立两大基准数据集（arXiv: 访问 -> 引用，GitHub: 推送/星标 -> 分叉），为跨域长期时序的滞后预测提供标准化框架与基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交和使用数据中，早期交互信道的影响可能跨越长时间后才显现在目标结果上，需要统一的研究框架、数据集与评估方法来系统地探索此类 lead-lag 动态。

Method: 构建并公开大规模数据集（arXiv、GitHub），识别并验证数据中的 lead-lag 关系；对 Wikipedia、Spotify、电子商务、LinkedIn 等领域的潜在 LLF 动态进行定位；进行数据清洗、统计检验、分类测试，以及回归的参数化与非参数基线评估。

Result: 证明存在可观的 lead-lag 关系，并给出可用于长期时序 LLF 研究的高容量基准数据集与基线，数据门户开放，避免 survivorship bias。

Conclusion: LLF 可被确立为一类新兴的预测范式，本文提供数据集与基线，奠定系统研究的 empirical foundation，促使在社交与使用数据中的长期滞后预测的广泛探索。

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

### [15] [DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecoHD enables memory-efficient hyperdimensional computing by learning a decomposed parameterization with a small shared per-layer channel set, multiplicative binding across layers, and end-to-end training, yielding large parameter and energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard HDC decompositions use fixed atomic hypervectors, which are suboptimal for compressing learned class prototypes and can degrade concentration and robustness when shrinking the feature axis.

Method: Introduce a decomposed HDC parameterization: a compact, shared set of per-layer channels with multiplicative binding across layers and final bundling. A lightweight bundling head compresses along the class axis. Training is end-to-end, while inference remains pure HDC to suit in/near-memory accelerators.

Result: DecoHD achieves extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy loss (average ~0.1–0.15% below a strong non-reduced HDC baseline; worst case 5.7%). It is more robust to random bit-flip noise, and reduces trainable parameters by up to ~97%. Hardware-wise, it yields ~277x/35x energy and speed gains over CPU, ~13.5x/3.7x over GPU, and ~2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Conclusion: DecoHD offers a practical, end-to-end trainable decomposed HDC framework that preserves HDC’s robustness and ability to leverage near-memory accelerators, delivering substantial memory, computational, and energy efficiency with minimal accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

Conclusion: 建立了关于遗忘的原理性理解，为分析和提升通用学习算法的信息保持能力提供基础。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

Motivation: 解决对噪声序列的敏感性、提升对病毒进化层次结构的建模，以及在全球数据不均衡的情况下提升未来突变预测能力。

Method: 提出PETRA（Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer），利用来自系统发育树的进化轨迹表征作为Transformer输入，降低序列噪声对模型的影响；实现带权训练以应对地理与时间上的数据不均衡；对核苷酸突变和 Spike 蛋白突变进行预测，并在主要血统（如24F(XEC)和25A(LP.8.1)）上进行实时预测评估；代码在GitHub开源。

Result: 在加权Recall@1指标上，核苷酸突变为9.45%，Spike蛋白氨基酸突变为17.10%；基线分别为0.49%和6.64%；PETRA还能实现对主要血统如24F(XEC)和25A(LP.8.1)的实时突变预测。

Conclusion: PETRA通过去噪与利用进化层级结构，提升未来突变预测能力，对公共卫生监测与疫苗设计具有潜在价值，且开源便于复现。

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Conclusion: 图先验与模块化机制的耦合在可组合微调中具有协同效应，能够实现更高效、稳定的跨任务微调，同时降低冗余计算与路径冲突，适合大规模模型的多任务场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 该方法超越单纯的血糖控制，建立以个人核心代谢缺陷为导向的精准防治框架，开启糖代谢疾病预防的新时代。

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical

expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnU?Net model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the
atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.

TL;DR: 提出一种数据自适应的加权距离函数用于带筛选条件的近似最近邻搜索，相较固定惩罚方法提升 5-10% 的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的过滤式 ANN 方法使用固定、与数据分布无关的惩罚，难以泛化到具有不同标签和向量分布的数据集。

Method: 将过滤约束的目标建立为受限线性优化，学习反映过滤分布的权重，并将这些权重用于引导搜索及索引构建，改进图结构以更好地捕捉过滤语义。

Result: 实验表明，数据自适应的距离函数在准确性上比固定惩罚方法提升约 5-10%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个更灵活、可泛化的框架，用于带筛选条件的 ANN 搜索。

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

TL;DR: 提出一种可分解的符号回归方法，将变换器、遗传算法和遗传编程结合起来，生成可解释的多变量表达式以解释黑盒回归模型，并在不同噪声水平下表现出与基准方法相当甚至更好的拟合能力，同时能够恢复原始数学结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归多聚焦于最小化预测误差，易产生过于复杂或不准确的表达式；需要可解释且能揭示潜在物理规律的方程级表示，并且能够对黑盒模型进行自洽的解释。

Method: 1) 使用多集（Multi-Set）Transformer生成多条单变量符号骨架，描述每个变量对目标的影响与贡献。2) 用基于遗传算法（GA）的评估来筛选高质量的骨架子集。3) 通过遗传编程（GP）级联过程增量合并骨架，保持原有骨架结构。4) 对最终的多变量骨架进行GA驱动的系数优化。5) 在受控噪声下对比多种基线方法，评估插值/外推误差及对原始结构的恢复能力。

Result: 在具有不同噪声程度的实验中，该方法的插值与外推误差低于或与三种GP-based方法、三种神经符号回归方法和一种混合方法相当；与其他方法不同，该方法稳定地学习到与原始数学结构相匹配的表达式。

Conclusion: 所提出的可分解符号回归框架成功在解释性与拟合性之间取得平衡，通过骨架化的分解、级联合并与系数优化实现对潜在方程的可解释表示，且对噪声鲁棒性较好，具有将来扩展到更广泛数据和物理规律发现的潜力。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

TL;DR: 在数据稀缺的机场上通过迁移学习将源机场 Zurich 的轨迹生成模型迁移到 Dublin；扩散模型在仅需 Dublin 数据的极小比例（约 5%）时也能达到基线水平并显著优于从零训练的模型；潜在的 latent flow matching / latent diffusion 也受益，但泛化较弱；总体表明迁移学习可在 ATM 轨迹生成中大幅降低数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多中小机场缺乏充足的历史轨迹数据，限制了机器学习方法的应用和大规模仿真。通过将数据丰富机场的模型迁移至数据稀缺机场，提升数据效率和可行性。

Method: 将现有扩散与流匹配模型改造用于航空轨迹域，先在 Zurich 上进行预训练，然后对 Dublin 进行微调，数据量从 0% 到 100% 的 Dublin 数据逐步增加，评估不同模型在多种数据量条件下的迁移效果。

Result: 扩散模型在仅用 5% Dublin 数据时就具备竞争力，并在约 20% 数据时达到基线水平；在此基础上， latent flow matching 和 latent diffusion 也从预训练中受益，但收益波动，流匹配模型泛化较弱；在捕捉罕见轨迹模式方面仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 证据表明迁移学习能显著降低轨迹生成所需的数据量，使在历史记录有限的环境中也能生成真实的合成轨迹，具有在 ATM 大规模仿真中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

Motivation: 解决电子健康记录中时间不规律、模态差异大、语义结构复杂等问题，需统一表征、捕捉长期与短期动态，以及识别关键医疗事件的重要性。

Method: 输入多源医疗特征，使用特征嵌入实现结构化与非结构化数据的统一表示；引入可学习的时间编码以处理不均匀采样；采用多头自注意力进行纵向序列的全局依赖建模；设计语义加权池化以自适应调整关键事件权重；最后通过线性层输出个体风险分数。

Conclusion: 该工作提出的Transformer纵向建模框架有效整合异质EHR数据的时序与语义信息，提升风险预测能力，具备良好的扩展性和临床实际应用价值。

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在 MXFP4 的 PTQ 场景下评估现有量化方法，GPTQ 表现最佳；以全球旋转（rotation）为核心的做法在 MXFP4 上存在严重不兼容性，根源在于 MXFP4 的 PoT 块缩放与能量重分配之间的冲突。提出一种简单的分块旋转策略来适配 MXFP4，从而显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模激增，部署成本（内存、计算、能耗）成为瓶颈。MXFP4 作为新兴的低精度格式，具备跨硬件的广泛支持，亟需评估现有的 PTQ 技术在该格式上的适用性，并寻找能兼容 MXFP4 的有效量化策略。

Method: 对现有 PTQ 方法在 MXFP4 上进行系统性基准测试，分析旋转式方法与 PoT 量化的根本不兼容性，追溯原因至 MXFP4 中 PoT 块缩放与全局旋转导致的离群能量重分配之间的冲突；在此基础上提出一个简单的分块旋转策略以适配 MXFP4，并在多种大型语言模型上评估该策略的有效性。

Result: GPTQ 等方法在 MXFP4 上仍表现强劲；以旋转为核心的现有方法在 MXFP4 上存在严重不兼容性；提出的分块旋转策略显著提升了旋转法在 MXFP4 下的准确性，适用于多种 LLM。

Conclusion: 针对 MXFP4 等新兴低精度格式，分块旋转的改造为旋转类 PTQ 方法提供了可行路径，既能保持高精度，又具良好通用性，为后续在新格式上的 PTQ 研究提供了清晰方向和实践指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: 混合框架成功结合了 RLHF 的可扩展性和 PBO 的查询效率，为偏好学习提供更高效的解决方案；未来工作可探索不同的 acquisition 策略和更多应用场景。

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的DP框架成功将隐私感知的最近邻检索集成到DP-ICL中，提升了性能并确保对中心DP预算的合规性。

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

Method: 提出SCER，在嵌入层施加理论约束，鼓励模型关注核心特征并降低对虚假模式的依赖。该约束基于对不同域与类别的群体均值嵌入差异的分析，揭示最坏分组误差由 classifier 对虚假方向与核心方向的依赖强度控制。通过嵌入层正则化实现对虚假线索的抑制。

Result: 在多项视觉与语言任务上，SCER的 Worst-Group 准确率超过了前沿方法，展现出对分布转移更强的鲁棒性。代码公开可获得。

Conclusion: 嵌入层面的理论约束为提升最坏分组鲁棒性提供了一个系统化路径，理论与实验结果共同支撑该方法在跨模态任务中的可泛化性与实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

### [46] [The Illusion of Certainty: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs fails under ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418)
*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出在存在模糊性的数据上，现有的UQ方法表现接近随机，且多种估计范式（预测分布、内部表征、模型集合）均受限。作者引入 MAQA* 与 AmbigQA* 等带事实共现分布的模糊问答数据集，进行系统评估并给出理论解释，倡导重新思考UQ建模范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语言本质上具有不确定性（-aleatoric uncertainty），但现有UQ基准通常在无歧义的设定下评估。本文发现当数据存在模糊性时，现有UQ方法的性能显著下降，提示需要重新思考如何对LLMs进行不确定性估计。

Method: 提出带有 Ground-truth 答案分布的模糊问答数据集 MAQA* 与 AmbigQA*，从事实共现角度估计真实答案分布；对多种估计范式进行评估，包括直接使用预测分布、利用模型内部表示、以及模型集合；给出理论分析，解释为什么预测分布与集合估计在模糊情况下受限。

Result: 在存在模糊性的数据上，预测分布、内部表示和模型集合等不同估计范式的UQ性能均退化至接近随机水平；理论分析表明这些范式在模糊性条件下存在基本局限性。这一现象在不同数据集与估计范式之间具有一致性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的UQ方法在面对模糊数据时存在根本性不足，需重新思考建模范式与评估框架，以更好地处理现实场景中的不确定性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

Motivation: 在刑事司法等高风险领域，群体公平、个体公平与过程公平往往冲突，需要一个更易实现、可解释的公平框架，并应对偏见数据、潜在性别或少数群体偏好等挑战。

Method: 在标准群体公平基础上进行简单修改：不追求对所有保护群体的严格等量平等，而是最小化带权错误损失，同时对假阴性率差异设定一个小容忍度；并提出在三大类批评（偏见与不完整数据、潜在平权行动、子群约束爆炸）下的分析；最后给出一个以需求为基础、透明与问责、定向定义与解决方案为支柱的部署框架。

Result: 该方法使解更易获得、可能提升预测准确性，并揭示错误成本的伦理权衡；并将偏见、数据不完整、潜在平权行动和子群约束等问题纳入分析，提出面向公共决策系统的落地框架。

Conclusion: 提出一个实用的部署框架，将技术设计与公共正当性相连，强调需求导向、透明度与问责制，以及定向的、可操作的公平定义与解决方案，为使用风险评估工具的机构提供可执行的指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

TL;DR: LMC under data shifts treats shifts as extra SGD noise; learning rate and batch size determine convergence to the same vs different basins; LMC trades training efficiency against ensemble diversity; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how data distribution shifts affect linear mode connectivity and how training hyperparameters modulate convergence, smoothness, and generalization, with implications for ensemble methods.

Method: Empirical study; interpret data shifts as SGD noise; vary learning rates and batch sizes; assess whether models converge to the same local minimum or to different regions of the loss landscape; analyze error similarity across models and the implications for training efficiency and ensemble diversity.

Result: Data shifts behave as additional stochastic gradient noise; smaller learning rates and larger batch sizes reduce this noise, influencing convergence to particular basins with varying smoothness and generalization; LMC-sampled models tend to make similar errors more often than models in different basins, highlighting a trade-off where LMC balances training efficiency with gains from larger, more diverse ensembles.

Conclusion: LMC under data shifts provides a practical balance between training efficiency and the benefits of diverse ensembles; code and supplementary materials will be publicly released.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

Motivation:  ROMs offer efficient simulations for high-dimensional systems but lack robust, generalizable uncertainty quantification; existing UQ methods are often tied to specific architectures or training choices. A flexible, architecture-agnostic solution is needed.

Method: A post hoc, model-agnostic framework leveraging conformal prediction to produce statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline (latent dynamics, reconstruction, end-to-end predictions) without altering the underlying architecture or training procedure.

Result: Applied to a latent-space dynamical model for cloud microphysics; the method accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and provides quantified uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.

Conclusion: The proposed conformal-prediction-based, post hoc uncertainty quantification framework offers a flexible and generalizable tool for latent-space ROMs, enabling reliable probabilistic predictions without changes to the original model.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing

requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计摩擦界面以满足指定宏观摩擦规律是一个非唯一且计算成本高昂的逆问题。现有低维参数化和启发式搜索难以扩展到更复杂或非线性的摩擦规律。

Method: 构建变分自编码器（VAE）生成模型，从目标摩擦规律出发推断表面粗糙度。以参数化接触力学模型生成的2亿样本合成数据进行训练，实现仿真自由的高效候选拓扑生成。

Result: 模型能够高效生成符合目标摩擦规律的表面形貌候选，并分析了准确性、吞吐量与解的多样性之间的权衡，展示了生成式建模在该逆设计任务中的潜力与局限。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过定制表面拓扑实现近实时控制摩擦行为提供路线，但需在准确性、速度和解的多样性之间进行权衡，并考虑数据覆盖、泛化能力与实际仿真成本等实际问题。

Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.

*Aniket Jivani,Cosmin Safta,Beckett Y. Zhou,Xun Huan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: BF-KLE-AL yields accurate, data-efficient surrogates for field-valued QoIs by combining bifidelity Karhunen-Loève expansion with regression-based PCEs and active learning using GP-estimated error to adaptively select high-fidelity samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an efficient surrogate modeling approach for field-valued quantities of interest under input uncertainty that preserves a direct input–output mapping and reduces computational cost.

Method: Construct a bifidelity KLE surrogate that uses inexpensive low-fidelity simulations to capture dominant trends and a limited set of high-fidelity simulations to correct bias. The KLE provides spectral representation, and PCEs link input uncertainties to KLE coefficients. An active learning loop uses Gaussian process regression to estimate surrogate generalization error via cross-validation and selects new HF evaluations by maximizing expected improvement.

Result: Demonstrated on three increasingly complex problems (1D analytic benchmark, 2D convection–diffusion, 3D turbulent jet via RANS/EDDES). The BF-KLE-AL framework achieves improved predictive accuracy and higher sample efficiency compared with single-fidelity and random-sampling baselines.

Conclusion: BF-KLE-AL offers accurate, data-efficient surrogate modeling for field-valued QoIs under uncertainty, with adaptive HF sampling enabling targeted bias correction and robust performance across simple to complex CFD-like problems.

Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for
field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach
combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions
(PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output
fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture
dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF)
simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables
accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further
improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively
selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error,
estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression.
New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement
criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL
framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a
one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion
system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy
simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent
improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to
single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.

Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of
measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the
fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing
methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these
connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying
tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms
which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a
numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process
methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the
ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models
compared to those which use an untilted reference path.

TL;DR: 给出基于解耦U统计和非交换Khintchine不等式的简单、易用的随机核矩阵期望谱范数界；对高维数据的内积核矩阵给出更紧的近似，并提供对各向异性高斯数据的新结果与核回归偏差的下界改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维数据场景下，需要对随机核矩阵的期望运算谱范数给出稳定、易用的界限。现有方法往往依赖复杂的矩母法或组合计数，难以直接用于实际估计；通过统一的界、把界限仅依赖于核函数的标量统计量与一个相关核矩阵，可在更广泛的核函数与数据分布下进行评估，并且可直接用于近似和偏差分析。

Method: 结合U统计的解耦结果与非交换Khintchine不等式，推导出对随机核矩阵的期望谱范数的上界与下界，这些界仅依赖于核函数的标量统计量以及一个描述k(具体实现的相关性的“相关核矩阵”）。随后将该框架应用于内积核矩阵在高维数据（样本量与维度多项式相关）下的近似，且给出在各向异性高斯数据情形的新近似与分析。

Result: 获得对随机核矩阵期望谱范数的上下界；提供对高维内积核矩阵的更紧近似；对现有依赖于矩方法和组合论的结果给出简化证明；给出各向异性高斯数据下的新近似和核回归偏差下界的改进。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了简单、易用且与核函数的局部统计相关的界，为高维核方法的理论分析与实际估计提供统一且更强的工具，且扩展到不对称/各向异性数据情形的近似与偏差分析，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a
random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function
$k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the
non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds
depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation
kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to
provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on
general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are
polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results
that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing
novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally,
using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower
bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.

Motivation: 提高对 min-vol NMF 在噪声环境中的鲁棒性与可辨识性，解决其在实际应用中的识别困难。

Method: 给出并证明在扩展的充分散度条件下，min-vol NMF 能在噪声数据中 identifiy groundtruth factors（识别出真实因素）。

Result: 在噪声存在的情况下，min-vol NMF 能识别出地面实测的因素，前提是数据点在由基向量生成的潜在简单形中足够分散。

Conclusion: 扩展的充分散度条件对 min-vol NMF 的鲁棒性提供理论保证，解释了在现实数据中何时能可靠地恢复真实因子。

Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used
successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical
kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However,
its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper,
we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of
noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered
condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in
the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一个严格的框架来比较在线SGD及其带动量和自适应步长的变体，澄清何时动量有益、何时可能有害，以及高维环境如何影响动态行为。

Method: 推导带动量的SGD在高维极限下的演化（SGD-M）及自适应步长的行为，结合时间重标和特定步长选择，与在线SGD对比；将框架应用于Spiked Tensor PCA和Single Index Models；分析带归一化梯度自适应步长的在线SGD及其固定点与收敛性。

Result: SGD-M的缩放极限在经过适当的时间重标和步长选择后，与在线SGD一致；若两算法使用相同步长，SGD-M会放大高维效应，可能降低性能；在高维情形下，自适应步长的在线SGD可得到更接近总体最小值的固定点，并扩大收敛步长的可取范围；对Spiked Tensor PCA和Single Index Models的分析体现了“早期预条件化”对稳定性与性能的提升。

Conclusion: 该框架从理论上系统揭示了带动量与自适应步长在高维SGD中的作用，帮助判断何时使用动量、何时采用自适应步长，以提升高维问题的收敛性与稳定性。

Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent
with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework
to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show
that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an
appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the
step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify
high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online
SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked
Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD
with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the
high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics
admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of
admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These
examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how
early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where
online SGD fails.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called
the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from
the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for
unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the
model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the
influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness.
Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that
retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing
constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the
$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and
$\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior
approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential
models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both
robustness and statistical efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing
distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the
exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in
online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent
approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they
slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a
forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data
point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we
propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective
adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional
shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out
update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive,
thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data
distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic
and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster
coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing
online conformal prediction methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: GEORCE-FM is a fast, local-chart based algorithm to compute the Fréchet mean on Riemannian (and Finsler) manifolds by jointly updating the mean and distances in each iteration. It includes an adaptive variant for large datasets and has proven global convergence, local quadratic convergence, and, for the adaptive version, convergence in expectation, with empirical superiority in accuracy and speed over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing the Fréchet mean on manifolds requires solving an optimization problem repeatedly, which can be expensive. A method that reduces per-iteration cost and scales to large datasets while preserving convergence properties is highly desirable.

Method: Introduce GEORCE-FM, which computes the Fréchet mean and the Riemannian distances in each iteration within a local chart to accelerate optimization. Extend the approach to Finsler manifolds and add an adaptive extension to handle large numbers of data points, aiming for scalable performance.

Result: Prove global convergence and local quadratic convergence of GEORCE-FM; prove that the adaptive extension converges in expectation; empirically demonstrate superior accuracy and runtime compared with existing baselines for Fréchet mean estimation.

Conclusion: GEORCE-FM provides a faster, scalable solution for Fréchet mean estimation on manifolds with strong theoretical guarantees and practical improvements over prior methods, with extensions to Finsler manifolds and adaptive strategies for big data.

Abstract: A central part of geometric statistics is to compute the Fr\'echet mean. This
is a well-known intrinsic mean on a Riemannian manifold that minimizes the sum
of squared Riemannian distances from the mean point to all other data points.
The Fr\'echet mean is simple to define and generalizes the Euclidean mean, but
for most manifolds even minimizing the Riemannian distance involves solving an
optimization problem. Therefore, numerical computations of the Fr\'echet mean
require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We
introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fr\'echet mean
and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster
than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and
introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of
data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and
local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in
expectation to the Fr\'echet mean. We further empirically demonstrate that
GEORCE-FM outperforms existing baseline methods to estimate the Fr\'echet mean
in terms of both accuracy and runtime.

Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine
learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al.,
2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct
density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat-
ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz
regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,
Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz
regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer
estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to
directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including
convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via
Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible
models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz
representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct
density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in
Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).

Conclusion: 提出以算子学习为统一框架来理解参数化PDE求解，形成可持续更新的资源，并指出未来的关键挑战，如高维参数、复杂几何与分布外泛化。

Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on
parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional
numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making
parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning
advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural
operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution
operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two
main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and
excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,
DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between
infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.
Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and
electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups
of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query
scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance
for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,
convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional
parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This
work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers
via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource
for this rapidly evolving field
