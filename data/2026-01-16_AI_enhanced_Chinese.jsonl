To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality.

We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines.

Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6279\u7b56\u7565 ABP\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e50\u89c2\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18ABP\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u56de\u62a5\u754c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u81f3\u591a\u5dee\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u77bb\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6c42\u89e3\u662fNP-hard\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u6279\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5206\u6279\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6279\u7b56\u7565\uff08ABP\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9ABP\u5efa\u7acb\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e50\u89c2\u56de\u62a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60ABP\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u6781\u9650\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u4e14\u56de\u62a5\u754c\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u4e4b\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6279\u7b56\u7565\u5f25\u8865\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u6279\u7684\u521a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60 ABP\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum-assisted federated learning (QFed) reduces model parameter count and training overhead using quantum techniques, achieving 77.6% parameter reduction on a VGG-like model for FashionMNIST while maintaining accuracy, suggesting potential gains for edge FL systems.", "motivation": "Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaboration but faces statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and high computational costs.

This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\u00f6s-Renyi and scale-free Barab\u00e1si-Albert ensembles.

Kushner", "Shalmali Joshi"], "title": "A pipeline for enabling path-specific causal fairness in observational health data", "comment": null, "summary": "When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u504f\u89c1 foundation \u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u7531\u533b\u751f\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u4e0e\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u533b\u7597\u60c5\u5883\u76f8\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u533b\u7597\u60c5\u5883\u4e0e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u6f14\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u672a\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684 foundation \u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u533b\u7597 ML \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u501f\u52a9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u53e3\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9 fairness-accuracy \u6743\u8861\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u5c42\u9762\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u672a\u7ecf fairness \u7ea6\u675f\u7684 foundation \u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5177\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5e7f\u6cdb\u533b\u7597\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7ba1\u9053\u3002"}}

Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff08Kinematic Tokenization\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u6837\u6761\u5e76\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6837\u6761\u7cfb\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8dc3\u52a8\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u3002\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8d44\u4ea7\u65e5\u9891\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5f03\u6743\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u57fa\u51c6\u5bb9\u6613\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6e05\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u8fde\u7eed\u6837\u6761\u6807\u8bb0\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bb9\u6613\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u76ee\u6807\u5e26\u6709\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u4fc3\u4f7f\u62d2\u7edd\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5f03\u6743\u635f\u5931\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4-\u5bfc\u6570\u7cfb\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u6837\u6761\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6837\u6761\u7cfb\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8dc3\u52a8\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u3002\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u8d44\u4ea7\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6210\u4ea4\u91cf\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8d44\u4ea7\u65e5\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4ee5\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u3001\u5f03\u6743\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u591a\u4ece\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u6e05\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\uff08Liquidation Equilibrium\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8fde\u7eed\u6837\u6761\u6807\u8bb0\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u8bb0\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5e26\u6709\u5f03\u6743\u635f\u5931\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6821\u51c6\u3002"}}

We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants.

Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k.

However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation.

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines.

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\\% of the training data.

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Sparse-RL\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u653e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u51cf\u5c0f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528RL\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0cKey-Value\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u957f\u671f\u6eda\u52a8\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709 KV \u538b\u7f29\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758fRL\uff08Sparse-RL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u653e\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling \u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3 dense old policy\u3001sparse sampler policy \u4e0e learner policy \u4e09\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSparse-RL \u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56de\u653e\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Sparse-RL \u5728\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u5408\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5929\u7136\u5177\u5907\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u6a21\u578b RL \u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u7f72\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations.

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant.

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations.

Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension.

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient.

Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients.

The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models.

However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition.

To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness.

We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy.
