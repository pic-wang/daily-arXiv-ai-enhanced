Abstract: Learning DAG structures from purely observational data remains a long-standing challenge across scientific domains. An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.

Abstract: We introduce FedSGM, a unified framework for federated constrained optimization that addresses four major challenges in federated learning (FL): functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning. Finally, we validate the theoretical guarantees of FedSGM via experimentation on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) tasks.

Abstract: College students experience many stressors, resulting in high levels of anxiety and depression. Wearable technology provides unobtrusive sensor data that can be used for the early detection of mental illness. However, current research is limited concerning the variety of psychological instruments administered, physiological modalities, and time series parameters. In this research, we collect the Student Mental and Environmental Health (StudentMEH) Fitbit dataset from students at our institution during the pandemic. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of predictive machine learning models to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress using different Fitbit modalities. Our findings indicate potential in physiological modalities such as heart rate and sleep to screen for mental illness with the F1 scores as high as 0.79 for anxiety, the former modality reaching 0.77 for stress screening, and the latter modality achieving 0.78 for depression. This research highlights the potential of wearable devices to support continuous mental health monitoring, the importance of identifying best data aggregation levels and appropriate modalities for screening for different mental ailments.

Abstract: The sample complexity of multi-group learning is shown to improve in the group-realizable setting over the agnostic setting, even when the family of groups is infinite so long as it has finite VC dimension. The improved sample complexity is obtained by empirical risk minimization over the class of group-realizable concepts, which itself could have infinite VC dimension. Implementing this approach is also shown to be computationally intractable, and an alternative approach is suggested based on improper learning.

Motivation: GP 在中等到大规模数据上的训练成本高，存在信息损失与近似之间的权衡，需改进训练目标和近似方法以提升精度和效率。

Method: 引入投影似然 PL，使用数据的低维线性投影；推导信息损失的闭式表达；通过单位球上的随机投影来降低信息损失；与精确GP训练和变分自由能（VFE）稀疏GP进行对比，覆盖多种优化器、核函数和中等规模数据集。

Result: 给出 PL 信息损失的闭式表达；实验表明单位球上的随机投影能降低信息损失；PL 在准确性和计算效率方面优于精确GP和 VFE 稀疏GP，结论在不同优化器、核和数据集上成立。

Conclusion: 投影似然为 GP 训练提供更优的权衡，特别是在中等规模数据集上，PL 可实现更高的准确性和效率；随机投影在降低信息损失方面具有显著作用。

Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.

Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

Abstract: This paper provides a fresh view of the neural network (NN) data flow problem, i.e., identifying the NN connections that are most important for the performance of the full model, through the lens of graph theory. Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种单环、基于第一阶梯度的演员-评论家算法来解决结构化的双层优化问题，其中上层为平滑目标，下层为基于MDP的策略优化；通过惩罚化 reformulation 与衰减熵正则化实现对上层超梯度的渐近无偏估计，且在特定的Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件下给出有限时间与有限样本收敛性；在GridWorld和RLHF任务上给出验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中的双层优化问题中，上层决策变量控制下层MDP的奖励，且上层目标依赖于下层最优策略。现有方法往往需要二阶信息、对下层施加强正则化，或通过嵌套循环低效地利用样本，因此亟需一种高效的、仅依赖一阶信息的优化方法。

Method: 提出基于惩罚项重构的单环第一阶演员-评论家算法；在下层RL目标中加入衰减熵正则化，使得在不完全求解未正则化RL问题的情况下也能实现渐近无偏的上层超梯度估计；通过对下层残差的分析，在特殊的Polyak-Lojasiewicz条件下推导出原始未正则化双层问题的有限时间与有限样本收敛性；并给出收敛到驻点的理论结果。

Result: 理论上证明算法能够在有限时间和有限样本内收敛到原始未正则化双层优化问题的驻点；在GridWorld目标位置问题与通过人类反馈进行的RLHF任务中进行了实验验证，展示方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种高效的单环一阶方法解决结构化双层强化学习优化问题，避免对下层求解完整未正则化RL问题的需求，且具有理论收敛性保障与实证效果，特别是通过衰减熵正则化实现对上层梯度的无偏估计。

Abstract: We study a structured bi-level optimization problem where the upper-level objective is a smooth function and the lower-level problem is policy optimization in a Markov decision process (MDP). The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. We validate the performance of our method through experiments on a GridWorld goal position problem and on happy tweet generation through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have emerged as the dominant approaches for aligning Large Language Models with human intent. While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Thus, we argue that our results provide new theoretical evidence for the empirically observed generalization of LLMs after RLHF.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rare-event prediction is critical in domains such as healthcare, finance, reliability engineering, customer support, aviation safety, where positive outcomes are infrequent yet potentially catastrophic. Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.

TL;DR: 在 VC 理论中通过带 Berry-Esseen 误差控制的正态近似实现统一概率收敛的中等偏差提升，改进了传统的 Hoeffding 基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视概率部分，寻求对经验概率与理论概率之间的一致性与收敛速率的更精确界限，尤其在有限样本与大样本情形的衔接。

Method: 放弃在最后一步使用 Hoeffding 不等式，改用带明确 Berry-Esseen 误差的正态近似，对相关分布进行中等偏差下的尖锐化估计。

Result: 实现对 VC 估计的中等偏差 sharpen；在主导的指数项中新增一个与 (ε√n) 相关的因子，尺度为 O((ε√n)^{-1})，当 ε√n 较大时提供更紧的上界。

Conclusion: 将 Berry-Esseen 控制整合到 VC 分析，得到对统一收敛率的更细致分析，可能扩展 VC 理论的适用性与精度。

Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.

TL;DR: KL在无显著模型偏差时收敛更快；Wasserstein在存在模型不匹配时更鲁棒；两者存在信息定义上的取舍，给出在实际BED中的选取指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BED依赖於效用函数的选取；KL与Wasserstein各自的优点与局限性尚存争议。文中通过 toy 例证揭示 Wasserstein 在固定形状后验分布的地理位置敏感性，可能导致与信息增益无关的错误奖励；随后在经典源反演问题上对比两者。

Method: 使用 toy 实例展示 Wasserstein 的局限性；在 BED 文献中的经典源反演问题进行系统比较，评估在没有模型偏差下 KL 的收敛性与在存在模型偏差时 Wasserstein 的鲁棒性。

Result: 结论是：在模型偏差可忽略时，KL 更快收敛；存在模型偏差时，Wasserstein 的序贯 BED 更鲁棒。两者各有优劣，取决于是否信任模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 对效用函数的权衡给出实际 BED 选择的指南：若对模型偏差控制较好，优先使用 KL；如存在显著模型不匹配，应考虑 Wasserstein 或结合其他鲁棒度度量来提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing experiments that systematically gather data from complex physical systems is central to accelerating scientific discovery. While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.

Abstract: We investigate two important tasks in odor-related property modeling: Vapor Pressure (VP) and Odor Threshold (OP). To evaluate the model's out-of-distribution (OOD) capability, we adopt the Bemis-Murcko scaffold split. In terms of features, we introduce the rich A20/E17 molecular graph features (20-dimensional atom features + 17-dimensional bond features) and systematically compare GINE and PNA backbones. The results show: for VP, PNA with a simple regression head achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.21 (normalized space); for the OP single task under the same scaffold split, using A20/E17 with robust training (Huber/winsor) achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.60-0.61. For multitask training, we propose a **"safe multitask"** approach: VP as the primary task and OP as the auxiliary task, using delayed activation + gradient clipping + small weight, which avoids harming the primary task and simultaneously yields the best VP generalization performance. This paper provides complete reproducible experiments, ablation studies, and error-similarity analysis while discussing the impact of data noise and method limitations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Environments are the bottleneck for self-improving agents. Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds. These results demonstrate that simple RL succeeds when environments scale.

Result: 在 Apple、GCB、S&P 500、LendingClub 分类任务等金融数据集上，显示均方误差下降、R^2 提高；ROC-AUC 受限于分类任务，但 BrownianReLU 及所选激活在准确性与灵敏度之间的权衡更具实用意义。

Conclusion: BrownianReLU 有效提升梯度传播与学习稳定性，改善回归与分类任务的预测性能与泛化能力，適用于包含噪声和非平稳性的金融序列的深度模型。

Abstract: Deep learning models are effective for sequential data modeling, yet commonly used activation functions such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU often exhibit gradient instability when applied to noisy, non-stationary financial time series. This study introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function induced by Brownian motion that enhances gradient propagation and learning stability in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Using Monte Carlo simulation, BrownianReLU provides a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs, mitigating the dying ReLU problem. The proposed activation is evaluated on financial time series from Apple, GCB, and the S&P 500, as well as LendingClub loan data for classification. Results show consistently lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, indicating improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Although ROC-AUC metric is limited in classification tasks, activation choice significantly affects the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity, with Brownian ReLU and the selected activation functions yielding practically meaningful performance.

Abstract: The study on the expressive power of transformers shows that transformers are permutation equivariant, and they can approximate all permutation-equivariant continuous functions on a compact domain. However, these results are derived under real parameters and exact operations, while real implementations on computers can only use a finite set of numbers and inexact machine operations with round-off errors. In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness refers to a model's ability to resist perturbation of inputs, while distribution robustness evaluates the performance of the model under data shifts. Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\ell_\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness.

Abstract: Discovery of sensitive and biologically grounded biomarkers is essential for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural MRI is widely available but typically relies on hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness or volume. We ask whether self-supervised learning (SSL) can uncover more powerful biomarkers from the same data. Existing SSL methods underperform FreeSurfer-derived features in disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction. We introduce Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a new SSL framework that integrates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while maximizing additional augmentation-invariant information. R-NCE outperforms traditional features and existing SSL methods across multiple benchmarks, including AD conversion prediction. To assess biological relevance, we derive Brain Age Gap (BAG) measures and perform genome-wide association studies. R-NCE-BAG shows high heritability and associations with MAPT and IRAG1, with enrichment in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating sensitivity to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes.

Abstract: Data set composed of categorical features is very common in big data analysis tasks. Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.

TL;DR: BoostFGL is a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware Federated Graph Learning that combats fairness gaps caused by label skew, topology confounding, and update dilution via three coordinated boosts (client-side node, client-side topology, server-side model) and achieves notable fairness gains with maintained overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated graph learning, average accuracy can conceal severe underperformance on disadvantaged node groups due to label skew toward majority patterns, biased message propagation, and dilution of updates from hard clients.

Method: Introduce three mechanisms: (1) Client-side node boosting to emphasize under-served nodes in local training; (2) Client-side topology boosting to reallocate propagation toward reliable but underused structures and dampen misleading neighborhoods; (3) Server-side model boosting to perform difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation that retains informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show substantial fairness gains, with Overall-F1 increasing by 8.43% and overall performance remaining competitive against strong FGL baselines.

Conclusion: BoostFGL demonstrates that a coordinated boosting strategy can improve fairness in federated graph learning without sacrificing total accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of disentangling node, topology, and aggregation challenges.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across decentralized subgraphs without exposing raw data. While existing FGL methods often achieve high overall accuracy, we show that this average performance can conceal severe degradation on disadvantaged node groups. From a fairness perspective, these disparities arise systematically from three coupled sources: label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding in message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. To address this, we propose \textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL. BoostFGL introduces three coordinated mechanisms: \ding{182} \emph{Client-side node boosting}, which reshapes local training signals to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; \ding{183} \emph{Client-side topology boosting}, which reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable yet underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; and \ding{184} \emph{Server-side model boosting}, which performs difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show that BoostFGL delivers substantial fairness gains, improving Overall-F1 by 8.43\%, while preserving competitive overall performance against strong FGL baselines.

Conclusion: 提出一种解耦推理延迟和计算复杂度的自适应图模型，为基于图的非参数学习提供新的结构范式，解决 kNN 的长期推理瓶颈。

Abstract: The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a cornerstone of non-parametric classification in artificial intelligence, yet its deployment in large-scale applications is persistently constrained by the computational trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Existing approximate nearest neighbor solutions accelerate retrieval but often degrade classification precision and lack adaptability in selecting the optimal neighborhood size (k). Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy. These findings offer a scalable, robust solution to the long-standing inference bottleneck of kNN, establishing a new structural paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.

Abstract: Understanding why Transformers perform so well remains challenging due to their non-convex optimization landscape. In this work, we analyze a shallow Transformer with $m$ independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime. Our analysis reveals two main findings: (i) the width required for nonasymptotic guarantees scales only logarithmically with the sample size $n$, and (ii) the optimization error is independent of the sequence length $T$. This contrasts sharply with recurrent architectures, where the optimization error can grow exponentially with $T$. The trade-off is memory: to keep the full context, the Transformer's memory requirement grows with the sequence length. We validate our theoretical results numerically in a teacher-student setting and confirm the predicted scaling laws for Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DANCE is a TAG-FGL framework with graph condensation (GC) and model-in-the-loop condensation refresh to reduce LLM overhead while maintaining accuracy, achieving 2.33% accuracy gain at 8% condensation with 33.42% fewer tokens across 8 TAG datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAG-FGL faces three core issues: (i) high overhead from LLMs processing long texts, (ii) suboptimal performance when using fixed one-shot condensation, and (iii) lack of interpretability due to black-box summaries.

Method: DANCE introduces round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh guided by the latest global model and keeps provenance by storing evidence packs that link predictions to specific neighbors and source text spans.

Result: Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE yields a 2.33% accuracy improvement at an 8% condensation ratio and uses 33.42% fewer tokens than baseline methods.

Conclusion: DANCE effectively tackles overhead, suboptimality, and interpretability in TAG-FGL by combining iterative, model-aware condensation with interpretable evidence, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training on graph data across multiple clients. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \textbf{2.33\%} at an \textbf{8\%} condensation ratio, with \textbf{33.42\%} fewer tokens than baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are powerful but prone to object hallucinations, which describe non-existent entities and harm reliability. While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization.

Abstract: We investigate whether high-frequency key collisions are a primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory. To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.
  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent "hot-to-cold advantage flip" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.
  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.

Abstract: Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Train delays result from complex interactions between operational, technical, and environmental factors. While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have become a widely used approach for modeling 3D atomistic systems. However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{A}xis-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\mathrm{SO}(3) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \textbf{20$\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer interpretable insights into machine learning predictions by answering ``what if?" questions. However, in real-world settings where models are frequently updated, existing counterfactual explanations can quickly become invalid or unreliable. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $δ$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $ε$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\langle δ, ε\rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships is critical for healthcare. Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.

Abstract: In many learning tasks, certain requirements on the processing of individual data samples should arguably be formalized as strict constraints in the underlying optimization problem, rather than by means of arbitrary penalties. We show that, in these scenarios, learning can be carried out exploiting a sequential penalty method that allows to properly deal with constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess convergence guarantees under assumptions that are reasonable in deep learning scenarios. Moreover, the results of experiments on image processing tasks show that the method is indeed viable to be used in practice.

Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.

Abstract: We demonstrate the power of human-LLM collaboration in tackling open problems in theoretical computer science. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lovász's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.
  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Transformer-based sequence models with black-box access to their outputs. In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.

Abstract: The minimal norm weight perturbations of DNNs required to achieve a specified change in output are derived and the factors determining its size are discussed. These single-layer exact formulae are contrasted with more generic multi-layer Lipschitz constant based robustness guarantees; both are observed to be of the same order which indicates similar efficacy in their guarantees. These results are applied to precision-modification-activated backdoor attacks, establishing provable compression thresholds below which such attacks cannot succeed, and show empirically that low-rank compression can reliably activate latent backdoors while preserving full-precision accuracy. These expressions reveal how back-propagated margins govern layer-wise sensitivity and provide certifiable guarantees on the smallest parameter updates consistent with a desired output shift.

Abstract: Crop type maps from satellite remote sensing are important tools for food security, local livelihood support and climate change mitigation in smallholder regions of the world, but most satellite-based methods are not well suited to smallholder conditions. To address this gap, we establish a four-part criteria for a useful embedding-based approach consisting of 1) performance, 2) plausibility, 3) transferability and 4) accessibility and evaluate geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings -based approaches using TESSERA and AlphaEarth against current baseline methods for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal. We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method. These results indicate that TESSERA embeddings are an effective approach for crop type classification and mapping tasks in Senegal.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励函数设计在强化学习中极易错配任务目标，且需要大量迭代。TAC提供一个衡量指标以评估奖励 induced 偏好与领域专家偏好的一致性；同时提出可微分的 Soft-TAC，作为从人类偏好数据学习奖励模型的优化目标，以降低手工调参的工作量并提升策略质量。

Method: 1) 使用 Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC) 衡量奖励函数诱导的偏好与专家偏好的一致性；通过对 Lunar Lander 的人因研究，比较有无 TAC 指导的奖励权重调参。2) 提出 Soft-TAC 的可微分近似，将其作为损失函数，用于从人类偏好数据训练奖励模型；在 Gran Turismo 7 中验证，Soft-TAC 训练的奖励模型能够更好地捕捉偏好目标，得到的策略比使用标准交叉熵损失训练的模型表现出更显著的行为差异。

Result: 实验结果显示：在 Lunar Lander 实验中，携带 TAC 的奖励调参使参与者得到更高性能的奖励函数，并报告较低的认知负荷；但总体而言，手工设计奖励仍然需要较大工作量。Soft-TAC 在 Gran Turismo 7 的验证中，训练出的奖励模型能更好地对齐偏好目标，产生更具差异性的策略行为。

Conclusion: TAC可作为实用工具用于奖励调参并可作为从人类偏好学习奖励的目标函数，但未来仍需解决手工设计的工作强度问题，以及在更复杂域中的扩展与鲁棒性。

Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.

Abstract: While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.
  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.
  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.

Abstract: In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

TL;DR: Using Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) to augment IoT attack data for ML-based IDS; improves class balance and IDS performance, with F1 up to 0.99 on DDoS and Mirai, while reducing sampling time ~25% vs data-space diffusion; demonstrates better fidelity and diversity than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in ML-based IoT intrusion detection degrades performance; existing oversampling or generative approaches struggle to achieve high fidelity, diversity, and efficiency simultaneously.

Method: Train a Latent Diffusion Model to generate synthetic attack samples in a latent space; compare against state-of-the-art baselines on three IoT attack types (DDoS, Mirai, Man-in-the-Middle); evaluate downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics.

Result: LDM-generated samples substantially improve IDS performance; F1-scores up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai; outperforms competing methods; LDM preserves feature dependencies, yields diverse samples, and reduces sampling time by ~25% compared to diffusion in data space.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion is an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, mitigating class imbalance in ML-based IoT IDSs.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.

Abstract: We study a general framework of distributional computational graphs: computational graphs whose inputs are probability distributions rather than point values. We analyze the discretization error that arises when these graphs are evaluated using finite approximations of continuous probability distributions. Such an approximation might be the result of representing a continuous real-valued distribution using a discrete representation or from constructing an empirical distribution from samples (or might be the output of another distributional computational graph). We establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance, without imposing structural assumptions on the computational graph.

Abstract: Learning a stationary diffusion amounts to estimating the parameters of a stochastic differential equation whose stationary distribution matches a target distribution. We build on the recently introduced kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS), which enforces stationarity by evaluating expectations of the diffusion's generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Leveraging the connection between KDS and Stein discrepancies, we introduce the Stein-type KDS (SKDS) as an alternative formulation. We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines.
