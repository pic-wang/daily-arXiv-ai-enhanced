We aimed to\nevaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability\nviolations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.\nWe conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates\ngenerated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,\nincluding the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to\nreflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,\nand NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level\ntreatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and\nwithout unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,\ncausal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect\nheterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there\nwas none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured\nconfounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it\nremained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,\nthough not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.\nViolations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of\nITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.\nNCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific\nunmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to\nsupport the credibility of individualized inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions.

To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization.

By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization.

However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inspired by\nscaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic\ninvestigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer\npipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model\nsizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both\nvalidation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We\nfurther identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and\nlearning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of\n$\\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute\nincreases.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper,\nwe present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time\ncomplexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the\nTask-Aware Memory Trigger ($\\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory\nmechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming\nsample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to\nadapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design\nthe Specialized Memory Updater ($\\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes\nthe context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language\ntasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling\nbenchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the\nexisting LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized\ntasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

Current steering methods, such as vector\naddition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional\nsubspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive\nto chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to\nunintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a\nnovel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating\nactivations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as\na geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular\nSteering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as\nrefusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering\nemotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular\nSteering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the\ntarget feature, further enhancing stability and coherence.

While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\".

Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to\nparameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean\ndistances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy\nbalancing convergence and diversity.

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of\natmosphere-climate dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
