Theoretically, we derive an upper bound that decomposes prediction-set size disparity into interpretable components, clarifying how label-clustered CP helps control method-driven contributions to unfairness. To facilitate scalable empirical analysis, we introduce an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator that approximates human assessment of substantive fairness across diverse modalities.

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features.

A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios.

We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum.

PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference.

These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process.

In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers.

In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction.

Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior.

In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods.

Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines.

At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens.

An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5e26\u5ba1\u67e5\uff08censored\uff09\u9700\u6c42\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b0\u95fb\u8d29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e worst-case \u5fcf\u6094/\u5931Real\uff08regret\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790 Kaplan-Meier \u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9ad8\u5e93\u5b58\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ec5\u5c06\u9500\u552e\u89c6\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u4fe1\u606f\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u5e93\u5b58\u6c34\u5e73\u6240\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u5220\u5931\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u5ba1\u67e5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62 regret \u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u964d\u7ef4\u5230\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u6c34\u5e73\u7ed9\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u5206\u6790 Kaplan-Meier \u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5e93\u5b58\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ec5\u4ee5\u9500\u552e\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u5ba1\u67e5\u7d2f\u79ef\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\u56de\u62a5/\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5f3a\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0b\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u8bf4\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u9500\u552e\u5373\u9700\u6c42\u201d\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cPOS \u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u8d29\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5ba1\u67e5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u5e93\u5b58\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5f3a\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f18\u8d28\u7684 POS \u6570\u636e\uff08\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4ee5\u9500\u552e\u5f53\u9700\u6c42\uff09\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\u03c0$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\u03a0(\u03c0)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\u03a0(\u03c0)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\u03c1(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u653f\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e92\u4f9d\u77e9\u9635H^\u03c0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027E^s\u3001E^a\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u03a0(\u03c0)\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u03c1(E^s+E^a\u03a0(\u03c0))<1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u66f4\u7d27\u3002\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u754c\u9650\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u5206\u5757\u5750\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u8d28\uff08EDP\uff09\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u5b88\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e92\u4f9d\u77e9\u9635H^\u03c0\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001(E^s)\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c(E^a)\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u03a0(\u03c0)\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u5206\u89e3\u63a8\u5bfc\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u03c1(E^s+E^a\u03a0(\u03c0))<1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u754c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u5206\u5757\u5750\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff08\u5c0f\u03a0(\u03c0)\uff09\u6240\u5f15\u53d1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e5f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u6570\u7684\u754c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u6b64\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e26\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u5206\u5757\u5750\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u7684EDP\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5e26\u6709\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u754c\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding.

We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead.

In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts.

However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality.

Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients.

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts.

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency.

But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.\n  Our project page: https://canonical-multimodal.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model.

While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller.

To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features.

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions.

We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics.
