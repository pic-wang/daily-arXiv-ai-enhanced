Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/dice-group/PruneCEL/tree/K-cap2025

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved

prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot

experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning

varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for
solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces
training time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign
the CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to
avoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing
this approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in
the CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient
batched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled
by a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s > 1$ yields performance
improvements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original
CD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and
numerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we
implement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra
computations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art
solvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\times$ in average for
regularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/ECCD.

Abstract: Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior
efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled)
data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study
compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on
the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the
coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy
can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time
steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained
using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric
compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We
evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and
benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite
seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover
coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy
over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains
strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that
compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon
modeling of coupled PDEs.

Abstract: Expectile regression neural networks (ERNNs) are powerful tools for capturing
heterogeneity and complex nonlinear structures in data. However, most existing
research has primarily focused on fully observed data, with limited attention
paid to scenarios involving censored observations. In this paper, we propose a
data augmentation based ERNNs algorithm, termed DAERNN, for modeling
heterogeneous censored data. The proposed DAERNN is fully data driven, requires
minimal assumptions, and offers substantial flexibility. Simulation studies and
real data applications demonstrate that DAERNN outperforms existing censored
ERNNs methods and achieves predictive performance comparable to models trained
on fully observed data. Moreover, the algorithm provides a unified framework
for handling various censoring mechanisms without requiring explicit parametric
model specification, thereby enhancing its applicability to practical censored
data analysis.

their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling
variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for
assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our
theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal
influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence,
replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value
of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine

Abstract: We present a fully decentralized routing framework for multi-robot

a lander under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns. We
formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)

global topology updates or packet replication, unlike classical approaches such
as shortest path and controlled flooding-based algorithms. Through Monte Carlo
simulations in randomized exploration environments, GAT-MARL provides higher
delivery rates, no duplications, and fewer packet losses, and is able to
leverage short-term mobility forecasts; offering a scalable solution for future
space robotic systems for planetary exploration, as demonstrated by successful

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation
learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only
been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos.
In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and
multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we
introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes
heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and
reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable
learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt
the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a
strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse
spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower
reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better
preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results
establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data
arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face
increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model
retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like
self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create
complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly
understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares
self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation
tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and
Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and
compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis
reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection
effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We
further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality
influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a
real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content
localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent
effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when
deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for
selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource
constraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for
reproducibility at
