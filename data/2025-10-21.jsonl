Naively\nestimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g.,\nkernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from\nthe curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this\nreason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio\ndirectly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as\nthe odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an\nobservation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution.\nAdditionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a\ncontinuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of\nthe so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in\nthe Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that\nall three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call\nBregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can\nbe used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the\nnumerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show\nthrough simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation\nstrategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner.

To more\neffectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings\nproduced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive\nMahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions\nof truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a\nmatrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying\nstructure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require\nadditional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality\nfor real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE\nachieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the\ncompetitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%."}

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies.

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then\nemployed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the\nattachment strategy through reinforcement learning.

In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and\ncounterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:\nhttps://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL."}

Thus, apparent success suggests that\nLLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical\nstatistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly\nreason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization\nconcerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue\nthat realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)\ndeveloping robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to\nguard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine\nLLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage\nevaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We\noutline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent\npublications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and\npreventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.\nCompared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,\nthey perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for\nstatistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as\npriors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both\nLLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt\nscience-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal\ndiscovery methods suited to real-world inquiry."}

The theory indicates that the\noutcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the\nforget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is\ninfluenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it\nimpossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain\nEquivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM\npost-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,\nNPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms.

Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that\nsystematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.\nOur approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble\nSimulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on\nprogress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis\n(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational\nspace. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that\nsupports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and\nmachine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a\ncomprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different\nmetrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a\ndataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a\nvariety of folding complexities and topologies.

However, training of multimodal networks is typically\nhindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one\nof the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,\nhindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal\nimprovements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the\nModality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint\nfusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in\nmodality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively\nbalance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during\ntraining to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal\nmodel, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal\npredictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion\ntasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nresults show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion\nmethods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during\ntraining.

Extensive experiments on\nconventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent\nstate-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the\nstrongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and\nfaster consensus on rare classes.

En route to proving the correctness of our\nstopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the\nLaplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions.\nThird, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs.\nFor any budget $\\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected\nsample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant\nsmaller than $8$. Our algorithm outperforms existing $\\delta$-correct and\n$\\epsilon$-global DP BAI algorithms for different values of $\\epsilon$."}

Duncan"], "title": "Certified Self-Consistency: Statistical Guarantees and Test-Time Training for Reliable Reasoning in LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning\n(TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without\nadditional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical\nguarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for\ncertifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a\nstatistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the\naggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution\nwith high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration\nbounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority\nCertificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when\nsufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free\npost-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution\nby exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of\nsamples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new\npost-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between\nsharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central\ntest-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single\nstatistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning\nLLMs."}

However, most\nconvergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target\ndistribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work\nestablishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for\na general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions:\nweak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our\nframework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian\nmixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score\napproximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential\nintegrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based\ngenerative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic\ndata distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees\nfor the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the\nempirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory. Moreover, from a\npractical perspective, our explicit rates might be helpful in choosing\nhyperparameters, such as the step size in the discretization."}
