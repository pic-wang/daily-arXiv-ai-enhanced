### [1] [Linear Regression with Unknown Truncation Beyond Gaussian Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12534)
*Alexandros Kouridakis,Anay Mehrotra,Alkis Kalavasis,Constantine Caramanis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 在未知生存集的截断线性回归问题中，提出一个多项式时间算法，最低仅需子高斯分布假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 截断线性回归在统计与机器学习中历史悠久，现实中生存集往往未知；现有方法要么需要明确的生存集要么对分布有强假设，且不可避免地带来指数级依赖的时间复杂度。

Method: 提出一个新算法，核心是一个能在仅有正示例访问的情况下学习有限区间并集的子程序，前提是满足一定的平滑性条件；该子程序与截断回归参数估计相耦合，从而在未知生存集条件下完成回归推断。

Result: 在仅假设特征向量为子高斯的条件下，算法实现对回归参数的 epsilon 精度估计，时间复杂度为 poly(d/epsilon)，显著放宽了对分布的要求并降低了计算复杂度。该正例驱动的学习子任务也对正例学习的 PAC 学习具有潜在独立意义。

Conclusion: 首次给出未知生存集下的截断线性回归的多项式时间算法；依赖的正示例驱动的区间并集学习子过程可能对广义正例学习领域有独立价值。

Abstract: In truncated linear regression, samples $(x,y)$ are shown only when the outcome $y$ falls inside a certain survival set $S^\star$ and the goal is to estimate the unknown $d$-dimensional regressor $w^\star$. This problem has a long history of study in Statistics and Machine Learning going back to the works of (Galton, 1897; Tobin, 1958) and more recently in, e.g., (Daskalakis et al., 2019; 2021; Lee et al., 2023; 2024). Despite this long history, however, most prior works are limited to the special case where $S^\star$ is precisely known. The more practically relevant case, where $S^\star$ is unknown and must be learned from data, remains open: indeed, here the only available algorithms require strong assumptions on the distribution of the feature vectors (e.g., Gaussianity) and, even then, have a $d^{\mathrm{poly} (1/\varepsilon)}$ run time for achieving $\varepsilon$ accuracy.
  In this work, we give the first algorithm for truncated linear regression with unknown survival set that runs in $\mathrm{poly} (d/\varepsilon)$ time, by only requiring that the feature vectors are sub-Gaussian. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine for efficiently learning unions of a bounded number of intervals using access to positive examples (without any negative examples) under a certain smoothness condition. This learning guarantee adds to the line of works on positive-only PAC learning and may be of independent interest.

### [2] [A Regularization-Sharpness Tradeoff for Linear Interpolators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12680)
*Qingyi Hu,Liam Hodgkinson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一个用于超参数化线性回归的新正则化-尖度权衡框架，将选择惩罚拆解为正则化项（与插值器对齐的量化）和插值流形上的几何尖度项（对局部扰动的敏感度），用于Lp正则化（p≥2）并扩展到LASSO的p=1情形；通过插值信息准则进行理论分析并以随机傅里叶特征与多项式的真实数据集进行经验验证，显示该权衡能区分高性能与较弱的线性插值器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在过参数化设置中，经典的偏差-方差权衡往往失效，双降曲线（double descent）现象表明最小范数插值器也可能表现良好，因此需要新的权衡来理解正则化与插值行为之间的关系，特别是在高维、强拟合的场景。

Method: 提出一种正则化-尖度权衡，将选择惩罚分解为两个部分：正则化项（量化正则化项与插值器之间的对齐程度）和插值流形上的几何尖度项（量化局部扰动的影响）。给出Lp正则化（p≥2）下的插值信息准则一般表达式，并扩展到p=1的LASSO插补器，后者能产生更强的稀疏性。通过与之前对岭回归的信息准则的关系，建立理论框架并通过真实数据及随机特征/多项式的实验来验证。

Result: 提供了对于Lp正则化（包括p≥2与p=1的LASSO）在插值情景下的插值信息准则的一般表达，并通过实验验证了正则化对齐与几何尖度的分离贡献在区分高性能与较弱插值器方面的作用。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了超参数化线性回归中的正则化-尖度权衡，Lp正则化可通过对齐和尖度两项来调控插值行为；理论分析覆盖p≥2与p=1情形，实验结果支持理论预测，表明在实际数据中该权衡能帮助理解和选择更优的线性插值器。

Abstract: The rule of thumb regarding the relationship between the bias-variance tradeoff and model size plays a key role in classical machine learning, but is now well-known to break down in the overparameterized setting as per the double descent curve. In particular, minimum-norm interpolating estimators can perform well, suggesting the need for new tradeoff in these settings. Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an $\ell^p$ penalty. Inspired by the interpolating information criterion, our framework decomposes the selection penalty into a regularization term (quantifying the alignment of the regularizer and the interpolator) and a geometric sharpness term on the interpolating manifold (quantifying the effect of local perturbations), yielding a tradeoff analogous to bias-variance. Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for $\ell^p$ regularizers where $p \ge 2$. Subsequently, we extend this to the LASSO interpolator with $\ell^1$ regularizer, which induces stronger sparsity. Empirical results on real-world datasets with random Fourier features and polynomials validate our theory, demonstrating how the tradeoff terms can distinguish performant linear interpolators from weaker ones.

### [3] [Blessings of Multiple Good Arms in Multi-Objective Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12901)
*Heesang Ann,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 在多目标带宽问题中，当存在对多个目标都较好的多臂时，贪心策略可通过隐式探索实现近最优表现；首次在多目标与参数化带宽设置中无分布假设地引入隐式探索，并提出用于分析多目标带宽算法公平性的 Pareto 公平框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战在于多目标带宽的传统观念将其视为比单目标更复杂；若存在多个目标对应的多臂都很优秀，可能产生隐式探索的收益。本研究在缺乏上下文分布假设的条件下探索这一现象，并关注算法的公平性分析。

Method: 理论分析与经验性实验相结合，证明在存在多个“良好”臂的条件下，简单的贪心策略仍可实现强性能，同时引入隐式探索的概念；在此基础上提出 Pareto 公平框架，用以系统地分析和量化多目标带宽算法的公平性。

Result: 首次在多目标与参数化带宽设置中无分布假设地引入隐式探索；贪心算法在这些设置中可实现强性能，验证了隐式探索的有效性；提出 Pareto 公平框架，为多目标带宽算法的公平性分析提供了理论工具。

Conclusion: 隐式探索是理解和提升多目标带宽算法性能的关键因素，简单策略在合适条件下即可表现出色；Pareto 公平框架为分析与设计多目标带宽算法提供了系统性的方法论。

Abstract: The multi objective bandit setting has traditionally been regarded as more complex than the single objective case, as multiple objectives must be optimized simultaneously. In contrast to this prevailing view, we demonstrate that when multiple good arms exist for multiple objectives, they can induce a surprising benefit, implicit exploration. Under this condition, we show that simple algorithms that greedily select actions in most rounds can nonetheless achieve strong performance, both theoretically and empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce implicit exploration in both multi objective and parametric bandit settings without any distributional assumptions on the contexts. We further introduce a framework for effective Pareto fairness, which provides a principled approach to rigorously analyzing fairness of multi objective bandit algorithms.

### [4] [Random Forests as Statistical Procedures: Design, Variance, and Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13104)
*Nathaniel S. O'Connell*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种有限样本、基于设计的随机森林框架，将每棵树视为随机条件回归函数，给出森林预测的精确方差恒等式，区分有限聚合变异与持续存在的结构相关性，并揭示两大设计机制对协方差的下限作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对随机森林的描述多为算法性，缺乏统一的统计设计视角。本文旨在在有限样本和固定数据集上建立随机森林的设计-based 表述，以明确方差来源、两类变异的分解及其对树间依赖的影响，从而提供对 resampling、特征随机化和分裂选择的本征影响的定量理解。

Method: 建立每棵树为随机条件回归函数的设计化描述；利用全方差与全协方差定律推导森林预测的精确方差恒等式，区分有限聚合变异与持续性的结构依赖；通过对单棵树的离散 dispersion 与 树间协方差进行分解，揭示再利用训练样本和数据自适应分区对协方差的影响，形成两大设计机制。

Result: 得到一个严格的方差恒等式，揭示预测变异不可仅通过增加树的数量来消除的“协方差底线”；并明确 resampling、特征级随机化和分裂策略如何共同决定分辨率、树的变异性和依赖结构。

Conclusion: 森林被确认为 explicit finite-sample 统计设计，其行为由其随机化构造所决定，需要在设计层面考虑重采样、特征随机化和分裂策略以理解和控制预测变异。

Abstract: Random forests are widely used prediction procedures, yet are typically described algorithmically rather than as statistical designs acting on a fixed dataset. We develop a finite-sample, design-based formulation of random forests in which each tree is an explicit randomized conditional regression function. This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction.

### [5] [AdaGrad-Diff: A New Version of the Adaptive Gradient Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13112)
*Matia Bojovic,Saverio Salzo,Massimiliano Pontil*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种 AdaGrad 风格的自适应学习率方法，其自适应依据为连续梯度差的平方范数的累积，而非梯度本身的范数。该设计在梯度波动较小时尽量不削减步长，遇到曲率或不稳定时自动抑制步长，提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决常用梯度法对步长的敏感性以及 AdaGrad 只使用梯度范数导致的对曲率变化的不足，期望通过利用梯度差的信息实现更稳健的自适应学习率。

Method: 定义梯度差 g_t - g_{t-1} 的平方范数，记为 ||Δg_t||^2，将其累积作为自适应因子，与传统 AdaGrad 的梯度平方和分开使用或替代。获得新的更新规则，将步长按该累积项进行衰减，以在梯度变化大时降低步长，在梯度变化小时保留步长。可能包含额外的均值/滑动平均等稳定化。

Result: 在若干实际设置中，提出的方法比 AdaGrad 具有更强的鲁棒性，尤其是在存在显著梯度波动或曲率情况下，表现出更稳定的收敛与更强的泛化。数值实验展示了该方法对步骤大小的自适应性提升。

Conclusion: 基于梯度差平方范数的累积自适应学习率策略证明了提升 AdaGrad 鲁棒性与稳定性的可行性，未来工作可探索理论收敛性、对比更多任务及实现上的效率优化。

Abstract: Vanilla gradient methods are often highly sensitive to the choice of stepsize, which typically requires manual tuning. Adaptive methods alleviate this issue and have therefore become widely used. Among them, AdaGrad has been particularly influential. In this paper, we propose an AdaGrad-style adaptive method in which the adaptation is driven by the cumulative squared norms of successive gradient differences rather than gradient norms themselves. The key idea is that when gradients vary little across iterations, the stepsize is not unnecessarily reduced, while significant gradient fluctuations, reflecting curvature or instability, lead to automatic stepsize damping. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust than AdaGrad in several practically relevant settings.

### [6] [Abstractive Red-Teaming of Language Model Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12318)
*Nate Rahn,Allison Qi,Avery Griffin,Jonathan Michala,Henry Sleight,Erik Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes abstractive red-teaming to identify categories of natural-language queries that cause character violations in language models, using two algorithms; evaluates across 12-principle spec and 7 models; finds effective category generation; demonstrates examples that produce problematic outputs; aims to improve pre-deployment auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce deployment risk by predicting which queries trigger character violations with limited compute, enabling scalable pre-deployment auditing beyond full-scale deployment testing.

Method: Two algorithms for category search: (1) reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM to optimize a set of categories; (2) iterative synthesis of categories from high-scoring queries using a strong LLM.

Result: Algorithms consistently outperform baselines across 12-principle character specifications and 7 target models, generating qualitatively interesting categories. Examples include queries prompting model to predict the future or recommend illegal weapons, illustrating potential character violations and the need for auditing.

Conclusion: Abstractive red-teaming provides a scalable, deployment-relevant approach to auditing language-model character, offering practical categories and methods to reveal and mitigate violations before broad release.

Abstract: We want language model assistants to conform to a character specification, which asserts how the model should act across diverse user interactions. While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. "The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles," that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons. Overall, we believe our results represent an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character.

### [7] [The Appeal and Reality of Recycling LoRAs with Adaptive Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12323)
*Haokun Liu,Gyung Hyun Je,Marco Ciccone,Zhenlin Xu,Prasanth YSS,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 适配性合并大量LoRA模组可提升基准，但对提升超过在相同数据上训练新LoRA的收益有限；随机初始化的LoRA也能达到相似效果，提示主要是正则化效应而非跨任务迁移；只有在池中存在高度相关的LoRA时，才有正迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究从“野生”LoRA池（如 Hugging Face Hub）的复用是否能通过自适应合并带来收益，填补先前研究多聚焦于经过筛选或合成数据的LoRA的空白。

Method: 评估自适应与非自适应合并方法，提出基于设计空间广泛搜索的新方法；从近1000条用户贡献的 LoRA（基于 Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct）构建池；将对比基线模型、合并后的模型以及在相同数据上训练的新 LoRA 的性能；分析LoRA的选择和随机初始化对结果的影响。

Result: 自适应合并可改善基线模型性能，但对比在相同数据上训练新LoRA的收益并不明显；LoRA的具体选取顺序和随机初始值都对结果影响不大，性能相近；只有存在高度相关的LoRA时才出现正迁移。

Conclusion: 从 recycled LoRA 的提升更像是一种正则化效应，而非真正的跨任务正向迁移；要获得显著改进需确保池中的LoRA 与目标任务高度相关。研究同时公布了模型检查点和代码。

Abstract: The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found "in the wild" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online.

### [8] [Wireless TokenCom: RL-Based Tokenizer Agreement for Multi-User Wireless Token Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12338)
*Farshad Zeinali,Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi,Dusit Niyato,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Propose a hybrid RL framework for Token Communications in a multi-user downlink that jointly handles tokenizer agreement, sub-channel assignment, and beamforming, achieving better semantic quality and resource efficiency while reducing video freezing compared to H.265.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TokenCom requires a common semantic latent space, which hinges on agreeing on tokenizer models and codebooks among transmitters/receivers. In a multi-user downlink, this leads to a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for jointly selecting tokenizers, sub-channels, and beamforming vectors. The goal is to enhance semantic transmission quality and spectral/resource efficiency.

Method: Formulate the TA and resource allocation as a joint problem and implement a hybrid reinforcement learning framework: a Deep Q-Network (DQN) handles tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, while a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) handles beamforming. The setting involves a multi-antenna base station transmitting video token streams to multiple users.

Result: Simulation results indicate the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in semantic quality and resource efficiency, and reduces video freezing events by about 68% compared with a conventional H.265-based scheme.

Conclusion: A hybrid RL approach can effectively solve the joint Tokenizer Agreement and physical layer resource allocation problem in multi-user Token Communications, improving semantic transmission performance and reliability.

Abstract: Token Communications (TokenCom) has recently emerged as an effective new paradigm, where tokens are the unified units of multimodal communications and computations, enabling efficient digital semantic- and goal-oriented communications in future wireless networks. To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in terms of semantic quality and resource efficiency, while reducing the freezing events in video transmission by 68% compared to the conventional H.265-based scheme.

### [9] [Computationally sufficient statistics for Ising models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12449)
*Abhijith Jayakumar,Shreya Shukla,Marc Vuffray,Andrey Y. Lokhov,Sidhant Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在受限观测下学习吉布斯分布：对 Ising 模型，宽度 γ 的模型可在观测到 O(γ) 阶统计量的情况下重建参数、推断结构及学习耦合和磁场；若有结构先验，甚至可用更少观测实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，使用仅有的充分统计量来学习吉布斯分布被认为计算上很困难；实际问题往往无法获取完整样本；需要在受限观测下实现高效学习。

Method: 以 Ising 模型为范例，分析在仅获得有限统计量的条件下的学习能力，证明在 ℓ1 宽度 γ 下可通过观测至 O(γ) 阶统计量重建模型参数，并给出在具有结构先验时的更高效学习。

Result: 证明对于宽度 γ 的模型，参数、结构、耦合与磁场均可学习；在有结构先验时，观测要求进一步降低，学习问题可以在更有限观测下高效解决。

Conclusion: 计算和观测之间存在权衡；在受限观测条件下仍可实现对 Ising/Gibbs 分布的有效学习，结构先验能显著降低所需观测，拓展了从有限统计数据学习统计物理模型的理论与方法。

Abstract: Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\ell_1$ width $γ$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(γ)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.

### [10] [HyperMLP: An Integrated Perspective for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12601)
*Jiecheng Lu,Shihao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将自注意力视为随上下文动态生成权重的两层 MLP，提出 HyperMLP/HyperGLU，通过在特征和序列维度进行动态混合，在反向偏移（lag）布局下对齐自回归语义，实验上超越同等参数预算下的软最大注意力基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 打破将自注意力仅仅理解为概率查询-键的视图，给出一个统一、简单的自回归注意力视图，并通过动态权重和存储池实现输入条件的选择性记忆，进而提升表达能力与性能。

Method: 将注意力重写为动态两层 MLP，权重由上下文历史实例化；引入 HyperMLP/HyperGLU，在特征和序列空间实现动态混合，采用反向偏移布局以对齐自回归语义；给出理论表达能力分析，并在参数预算相同的条件下进行实验比较。

Result: 理论上对表达能力有新的刻画；在与相同参数规模的强基线（软最大注意力）比较时，HyperMLP/HyperGLU 显著优于它们。

Conclusion: 动态混合的 HyperMLP/HyperGLU 架构提供了对自回归记忆的有效替代，实现更强的表达能力和实证性能提升，挑战了以 softmax 为核心的主流注意力框架。

Abstract: Self-attention is often viewed as probabilistic query-key lookup, motivating designs that preserve normalized attention scores and fixed positional semantics. We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.

Abstract: This work introduces the Nirenberg Neural Network: a numerical approach to the Nirenberg problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on $S^2$ for metrics that are pointwise conformal to the round metric. Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.
  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones. The current capabilities of the Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrate that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions.

### [12] [Policy4OOD: A Knowledge-Guided World Model for Policy Intervention Simulation against the Opioid Overdose Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12373)
*Yijun Ma,Zehong Wang,Weixiang Sun,Zheyuan Zhang,Kaiwen Shi,Nitesh Chawla,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy4OOD: a world-model-based framework to forecast, counterfactualize, and optimize opioid policy interventions using a policy-conditioned spatio-temporal transformer and Monte Carlo Tree Search, with state-level data (2019-2024).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opioid policy interventions interact within a dynamic system; evaluating effects prior to deployment requires forecasting, counterfactual reasoning, and optimization, which current methods struggle to combine.

Method: Construct a knowledge-guided policy graph, model state-level spatial dependencies, and incorporate socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer. Train on state-month data (2019-2024). Use the trained model as a simulator for forecasting (forward pass), counterfactuals (alternate policy encodings), and policy optimization (Monte Carlo Tree Search). Build a dataset integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and policy encodings.

Result: Spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge improve forecasting accuracy; each architectural component contributes; a state-level 2019-2024 dataset supports the evaluation.

Conclusion: World modeling offers a data-driven framework for forecasting, counterfactual analysis, and optimization of opioid policies, enabling informed public-health decision support.

Abstract: The opioid epidemic remains one of the most severe public health crises in the United States, yet evaluating policy interventions before implementation is difficult: multiple policies interact within a dynamic system where targeting one risk pathway may inadvertently amplify another. We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We reformulate Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM), a class of dynamical generative models, showing that it admits an exact proximal formulation via an extended Brenier potential, without assuming that the target distribution has a density. In particular, the mapping to recover the target point is exactly given by a proximal operator, which yields an explicit proximal expression of the vector field. We also discuss the convergence of minibatch OT-CFM to the population formulation as the batch size increases. Finally, using second epi-derivatives of convex potentials, we prove that, for manifold-supported targets, OT-CFM is terminally normally hyperbolic: after time rescaling, the dynamics contracts exponentially in directions normal to the data manifold while remaining neutral along tangential directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VBE通过一个随机行动价值函数集合来产生基于集合误差的价值奖励，从而实现首次访问的乐观性和深度探索，提升对探索任务的表现，并可扩展到像Atari这样的复杂环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有以奖励奖金驱动的探索方法只能在观测到更高的奖励奖金后对该动作给予更高的价值估计，难以鼓励首次访问状态-动作的探索，因此需要一种在第一次访问时就引导探索的新方法。

Method: 维护一个随机行动价值函数（RQF）的集合；利用这些RQF的估计误差来设计价值奖金，使得价值奖金可以逐渐减少到零；通过对RQFs设计奖励，使得该奖金在第一步就产生乐观性，促进深度搜索。

Result: 在经典的探索基准任务上，VBE表现优于Bootstrap DQN以及两种奖励奖金方法RND和ACB；实验还演示其可扩展性，适用于更复杂的环境如Atari。

Conclusion: 基于ensemble误差的价值奖金能够提供有效的首次访问乐观性和深度探索，且具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Optimistic value estimates provide one mechanism for directed exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) provides a rigorous framework for learning causal structures from time-series data. Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.

Abstract: Estimating longitudinal treatment effects is essential for sequential decision-making but is challenging due to treatment-confounder feedback. While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.

TL;DR: 提出 Diverging Flows，通过对 off-manifold 输入强制“效率低下”的传输，单个模型同时实现条件生成和原生外推检测；在合成流形、跨域风格迁移和天气温度预测上评估，能在不牺牲预测保真度与推理延迟的前提下有效检测外推，提升流模型的可信度。


<details>

Motivation: 流模型在安全关键场景中容易对非在流形输入给出看似合理的输出，因平滑性偏差导致潜在的外推失败难以被察觉；需要一种机制来在同一模型中实现生成与外推检测的双重能力，以提升鲁棒性和可部署性。

Method: 在单个流模型中结构性地引入“效率低下的传输”（divergent transport）机制，使对 off-manifold 输入产生明显的偏离输出，从而实现外推检测；结合条件生成能力，兼容不同任务（合成流形、风格迁移、天气预测）以验证方法的通用性。

Conclusion: Diverging Flows 提供一个可在医学、机器人、气候科学等领域可信部署的流模型解决方案，通过同时支持条件生成与外推检测，提升系统的鲁棒性与可靠性。

Abstract: The ability of Flow Matching (FM) to model complex conditional distributions has established it as the state-of-the-art for prediction tasks (e.g., robotics, weather forecasting). However, deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by a critical extrapolation hazard: driven by smoothness biases, flow models yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, resulting in silent failures indistinguishable from valid predictions. In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.

Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) lie at the core of modern computing and communications systems. However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality.

Abstract: If LLM training data is polluted with benchmark test data, then benchmark performance gives biased estimates of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Typical decontamination filters use n-gram matching which fail to detect semantic duplicates: sentences with equivalent (or near-equivalent) content that are not close in string space. We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success, yet their growing parameter counts pose significant computational and memory challenges. Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary "full-rank" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.

Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键应用中缺乏可证明的安全保障，特别是在未知且非线性动态系统中需要对风险进行动态控制与回撤。

Method: 引入一个备份策略（盾牌）与高斯过程不确定性量化，预测潜在的安全违规并在必要时回滚到安全轨迹。利用盾牌收集的经验构建GP模型，通过内部基于模型的采样进行策略优化，实现无障碍探索与高效学习，同时确保安全性。

Conclusion: 提出一种可证明安全下界的安全强化学习框架，适用于未知与非线性系统，兼具样本效率和安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimal decision-making and control but often lacks provable guarantees for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel recovery-based shielding framework that enables safe RL with a provable safety lower bound for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems. The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary. Experience gathered by the 'shielded' agent is used to construct the GP models, with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling - enabling unrestricted exploration and sample efficient learning, without compromising safety. Empirically our approach demonstrates strong performance and strict safety-compliance on a suite of continuous control environments.

Motivation: 解决深度集成的三大现实问题：基模型冗余导致计算成本与条件数恶化、存在多重共线性时权重不稳定、元学习阶段易过拟合。

Method: 提出四阶段管线：1) 冗余感知投影，基于相关性与均方误差阈值 τ_corr=0.95 去除近共线预测；2) 统计元特征增强，提取集成统计量和交互项以恢复高阶结构；3) 使用交叉验证的正则化元模型（Ridge、Lasso、ElasticNet）进行堆叠；4) 引入反 RMSE 的混合阶段以降低正则化器选择方差。

Conclusion: regularized meta-learning 作为高维集成系统的稳定、部署友好的堆叠策略，具有更稳定的性能和更低的计算成本。

Abstract: Deep ensemble methods often improve predictive performance, yet they suffer from three practical limitations: redundancy among base models that inflates computational cost and degrades conditioning, unstable weighting under multicollinearity, and overfitting in meta-learning pipelines. We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($τ_{\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending. These results position regularized meta-learning as a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems.

TL;DR: Reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation using an autoregressive LM that maps target structures to sequences; train with supervised data, then fine-tune with reinforcement learning, including subset RL to boost efficiency; achieves state-of-the-art Boltzmann probability and 1.7x speedup across four datasets; code released.

Motivation: Combat the intractable RNA design problem caused by exponentially large sequence space and many competing folds by turning it into conditional generation, enabling reuse of a neural approximator across instances and eliminating per-instance optimization bottlenecks.

Method: Train an autoregressive language model to generate RNA sequences conditioned on target secondary structures. Start with supervised training on random structure–sequence pairs, then apply reinforcement learning to optimize end-to-end metrics. Propose subset selection strategies to reduce RL cost while improving quality. Evaluate on four datasets using Boltzmann probability and related metrics.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics (e.g., Boltzmann probability) and runs 1.7x faster than competitors.

Conclusion: Conditional LM generation provides a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design, with code and data available for reproduction.

Abstract: RNA design, the task of finding a sequence that folds into a target secondary structure, has broad biological and biomedical impact but remains computationally challenging due to the exponentially large sequence space and exponentially many competing folds. Traditional approaches treat it as an optimization problem, relying on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search. We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality. Across four datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics such as Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster, establishing conditional LM generation as a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

Conclusion: 提升了对可分数据上对数损失的 GD 动态理解，揭示非单调阶段的振荡在收敛中的作用，以及转变时间 τ 的关键性，给出在 2D 条件下近似紧致的上/下界。

Abstract: We consider the optimization problem of minimizing the logistic loss with gradient descent to train a linear model for binary classification with separable data. With a budget of $T$ iterations, it was recently shown that an accelerated $1/T^2$ rate is possible by choosing a large step size $η= Θ(γ^2 T)$ (where $γ$ is the dataset's margin) despite the resulting non-monotonicity of the loss. In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis of gradient descent for this problem when the data is two-dimensional: we show that GD with a sufficiently large learning rate $η$ finds a point with loss smaller than $\mathcal{O}(1/(ηT))$, as long as $T \geq Ω(n/γ+ 1/γ^2)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Our improved rate comes from a tighter bound on the time $τ$ that it takes for GD to transition from unstable (non-monotonic loss) to stable (monotonic loss), via a fine-grained analysis of the oscillatory dynamics of GD in the subspace orthogonal to the max-margin classifier. We also provide a lower bound of $τ$ matching our upper bound up to logarithmic factors, showing that our analysis is tight.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks, motivating its extension to vision language models (VLMs). While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.

Abstract: The intersection of Mean Field Games (MFGs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has fostered a growing family of algorithms designed to solve large-scale multi-agent systems. However, the field currently lacks a standardized evaluation protocol, forcing researchers to rely on bespoke, isolated, and often simplistic environments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to assess the robustness, generalization, and failure modes of emerging methods. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization. Based on our extensive empirical results, we propose guidelines to standardize future experimental comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的链式推理 (CoT) 虽提升推理能力，但变量长度的推理链造成高推理成本、冗余步骤与过度思维；基于奖励的长度控制或提示校准对超参数敏感且准确性下降风险高。需要一个更稳定、可解释、可控的高效推理训练框架。

Method: CRT 采用基于参考值的约束优化的门控机制，在训练中交替最小化推理长度与在性能低于参考时进行准确性矫正；提出两阶段训练：先发现最短且可靠的推理模式，再在学习得到的长度预算下精炼准确性，以防 verbose CoT 的回归。

Result: 实验表明 CRT 能在保持答案质量的同时，普遍降低令牌使用量；不仅通过缩短输出，还通过降低内部语言冗余提升推理效率，提出了新的评估指标；训练自然而然地产出跨若干中间 checkpoint 的解释长度序列，便于在不重新训练的情况下实现推理冗 length 的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: CRT 提供一个稳定、可解释且高效的后训练框架，能够有效 pruning 冗余推理、减少成本，同时维持鲁棒的正确性，且具备可控的解释长度与新的诊断指标。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training methods. While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.

While existing applications of the HDP predominantly focus on the Dirichlet-multinomial conjugate structure, the framework itself is considerably more general and, in principle, accommodates a broad class of conjugate prior-likelihood pairs. In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models. Our work extends the applicability of the HDP beyond the Dirichlet-multinomial setting and furnishes practical analytic results for researchers employing hierarchical Bayesian nonparametrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for aligning diffusion and flow-matching models with human preferences, yet practitioners face fragmented codebases, model-specific implementations, and engineering complexity. We introduce Flow-Factory, a unified framework that decouples algorithms, models, and rewards through through a modular, registry-based architecture. This design enables seamless integration of new algorithms and architectures, as demonstrated by our support for GRPO, DiffusionNFT, and AWM across Flux, Qwen-Image, and WAN video models. By minimizing implementation overhead, Flow-Factory empowers researchers to rapidly prototype and scale future innovations with ease. Flow-Factory provides production-ready memory optimization, flexible multi-reward training, and seamless distributed training support.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibit significant modality preference, which is a tendency to favor one modality over another. Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.

Motivation: 在 EHR 领域，跨域分布偏移导致模型性能下降，现有领域自适应方法多为黑箱，缺乏透明度。

Method: 将表征分解为不变与协变成分，监督两部分并约束正交；映射稀疏潜在维度到医学概念，进行针对性消融以量化贡献；在两个真实的 EHR 数据集上进行多域分割实验。

Conclusion:  ExtraCare 能在保持预测性能的同时提供可解释性，便于临床透明度和信任度提升。

Abstract: Deep learning models for clinical event prediction on electronic health records (EHR) often suffer performance degradation when deployed under different data distributions. While domain adaptation (DA) methods can mitigate such shifts, its "black-box" nature prevents widespread adoption in clinical practice where transparency is essential for trust and safety. We propose ExtraCare to decompose patient representations into invariant and covariant components. By supervising these two components and enforcing their orthogonality during training, our model preserves label information while exposing domain-specific variation at the same time for more accurate predictions than most feature alignment models. More importantly, it offers human-understandable explanations by mapping sparse latent dimensions to medical concepts and quantifying their contributions via targeted ablations. ExtraCare is evaluated on two real-world EHR datasets across multiple domain partition settings, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced transparency, as evidenced by its accurate predictions and explanations from extensive case studies.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale Large Language Models via expert specialization induced by conditional computation. In practice, however, expert specialization often fails: some experts become functionally similar, while others functioning as de facto shared experts, limiting the effective capacity and model performance. In this work, we analysis from a spectral perspective on parameter and gradient spaces, uncover that (1) experts share highly overlapping dominant spectral components in their parameters, (2) dominant gradient subspaces are strongly aligned across experts, driven by ubiquitous low-rank structure in human corpus, and (3) gating mechanisms preferentially route inputs along these dominant directions, further limiting specialization. To address this, we propose Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE), which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space. SD-MoE improves performance across downstream tasks, enables effective expert specialization, incurring minimal additional computation, and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing MoE architectures, including Qwen and DeepSeek.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FO-RI-FedAvg: a lightweight, modular extension of FedAvg for BEV federated learning that mitigates instability from intermittent connectivity and heterogeneous client participation by two mechanisms—adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization and non-integer-order local optimization—achieving better accuracy and more stable convergence, especially with reduced participation on BEV energy datasets VED and eVED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In realistic BEV federated learning, clients suffer from intermittent connectivity and varying participation; client heterogeneity causes drift and poor convergence for standard FedAvg. There is a need for lightweight, robust methods that preserve server-side aggregation while improving stability.

Method: Introduce FO-RI-FedAvg, which adds two client-side mechanisms to FedAvg: (1) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization that tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness; (2) non-integer-order local optimization that incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The server aggregation remains unchanged and only element-wise operations are added, with amortizable overhead; components can be toggled independently.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two real BEV energy prediction datasets (VED and eVED) shows FO-RI-FedAvg achieves higher accuracy and more stable convergence than strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.

Conclusion: FO-RI-FedAvg is a lightweight, modular improvement over FedAvg that enhances stability and accuracy in realistic BEV FL settings. It preserves server-side methods, introduces minimal overhead, and offers tunable components. Further work could explore theoretical convergence guarantees, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and applicability to other non-vehicular FL domains.

Abstract: Federated learning on connected electric vehicles (BEVs) faces severe instability due to intermittent connectivity, time-varying client participation, and pronounced client-to-client variation induced by diverse operating conditions. Conventional FedAvg and many advanced methods can suffer from excessive drift and degraded convergence under these realistic constraints. This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.

*Xin-Qiang Cai,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Verifier-independent curriculum reinforcement learning (VI-CuRL) stabilizes training and improves performance by using the model's own confidence to form a curriculum, achieving asymptotic unbiasedness and outperforming verifier-free baselines on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR relies on external verifiers; verifier-free methods suffer from destructive gradient variance (e.g., in Group Relative Policy Optimization). To scale, develop a verifier-free approach that controls bias-variance via curriculum based on model confidence.

Method: Propose VI-CuRL that constructs a curriculum from the model's intrinsic confidence, prioritizing high-confidence samples, thereby reducing action and problem variance and mitigating gradient variance. Provide theoretical analysis proving asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimator.

Result: VI-CuRL yields stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines on six challenging benchmarks, with and without verifiers.

Conclusion: VI-CuRL offers a principled verifier-independent framework that balances bias-variance through confidence-based curriculum, improving both stability and performance in verification-free reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning, yet its reliance on external verifiers limits its scalability. Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness. Empirically, VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.

TL;DR: MH-MoE通过对头部进行路由，缓解MoE Transformer中的记忆衰退问题，提升连续学习性能，在TRACE+Qwen模型上显著降低遗忘（BWT从11.2%降至4.5%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的多头注意力在路由输入的拼接导致路由器难以将不同头的信号分离，容易对“可分解的语义/结构因子”进行强耦合，从而在不同任务间产生梯度冲突，导致忘记。现有MoE在稀疏路由下仍有显著忘记，且路由受制于头部的组合信号，产生碰撞效应。

Method: 提出MH-MoE，在头级别对子表征进行路由，而非将所有头的信号拼接后再路由，从而提高路由粒度并减少组合碰撞。并在TRACE上基于Qwen3-0.6B/8B进行实验，比较与LoRAMoE等方法的遗忘表现。

Result: 发现路由的有效组合数N_eff越高，old-task损失在持续学习中越大；MH-MoE通过头级路由降低了组合碰撞，显著减小遗忘，在Qwen3-0.6B/8B上将BWT从11.2%（LoRAMoE）降至4.5%。

Conclusion: 通过头级路由来提升MoE Transformers的路由粒度，显著降低不同任务之间的参数干扰，提升连续学习表现，实验结果支持其在大模型MoE设置中的有效性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are often considered a natural fit for continual learning because sparse routing should localize updates and reduce interference, yet MoE Transformers still forget substantially even with sparse, well-balanced expert utilization. We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B, MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting, reducing BWT on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE) to 4.5%.

Conclusion: 证明了将分布式光纤传感与谱特征结合用于检测单车道异常的潜力，路径拟合与谱质心变化为关键要素，需进一步扩展数据集并提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: The distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) system is a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring technology that utilizes existing fiber infrastructure to effectively detect traffic congestions. However, detecting single-lane abnormalities, that lead to congestions, is still a challenge. These single-lane abnormalities can be detected by monitoring lane change behaviour of vehicles, performed to avoid congestion along the monitoring section of a road. This paper presents a method to detect single-lane abnormalities by tracking individual vehicle paths and detecting vehicle lane changes along a section of a road. We propose a method to estimate the vehicle position at all time instances and fit a path using clustering techniques. We detect vehicle lane change by monitoring any change in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking a reference vehicle along a highway. The evaluation of our proposed method with real traffic data showed 80% accuracy for lane change detection events that represent presence of abnormalities.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) are critical for ensuring the safety and resilience of cyber-physical systems such as power grids. However, existing machine learning models for time series anomaly detection often operate as black boxes, offering only binary outputs without any explanation, such as identifying anomaly type and origin. To address this challenge, we propose Power Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (PICODE) Networks, a unified, causality-informed architecture that jointly performs anomaly detection along with the explanation why it is detected as an anomaly, including root cause localization, anomaly type classification, and anomaly shape characterization. Experimental results in power systems demonstrate that PICODE achieves competitive detection performance while offering improved interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data or external causal graphs. We provide theoretical results demonstrating the alignment between the shape of anomaly functions and the changes in the weights of the extracted causal graphs.

Abstract: We present a family of novel block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds (mean approximately correct). While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\mathcal{O}(1/\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.

Abstract: Relational deep learning (RDL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning directly on relational databases by modeling entities and their relationships across multiple interconnected tables. As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress. In this paper, we introduce RelBench v2, a major expansion of the RelBench benchmark for RDL. RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that RDL models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, highlighting the importance of modeling relational structure explicitly.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are pivotal in processing dynamic graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable performance across various domains, yet their practical deployment is often limited by high sampling costs. While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

Abstract: Cellular identity and function are linked to both their intrinsic genomic makeup and extrinsic spatial context within the tissue microenvironment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers an unprecedented opportunity to study this, providing in situ gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution and illuminating the spatial and functional organization of cells within tissues. However, a significant hurdle remains: ST data is inherently noisy, large, and structurally complex. This complexity makes it intractable for existing computational methods to effectively capture the interplay between spatial interactions and intrinsic genomic relationships, thus limiting our ability to discern critical biological patterns. Here, we present CellScape, a deep learning framework designed to overcome these limitations for high-performance ST data analysis and pattern discovery. CellScape jointly models cellular interactions in tissue space and genomic relationships among cells, producing comprehensive representations that seamlessly integrate spatial signals with underlying gene regulatory mechanisms. This technique uncovers biologically informative patterns that improve spatial domain segmentation and supports comprehensive spatial cellular analyses across diverse transcriptomics datasets, offering an accurate and versatile framework for deep analysis and interpretation of ST data.w

Abstract: Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on a heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify a mismatch between SLA and a direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) a learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) a more faithful and direct sparse-linear attention formulation that uses a learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) a sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: The core of knowledge distillation lies in transferring the teacher's rich 'dark knowledge'-subtle probabilistic patterns that reveal how classes are related and the distribution of uncertainties. While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs.

Abstract: Split conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal coverage, but produces constant-width intervals that overcover in low-variance regions and undercover in high-variance regions. Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models. We propose Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP), which weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage -- the diagonal of the hat matrix -- deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as fast surrogate solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for collaborative model training in privacy-sensitive domains such as finance and healthcare. However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness.

Abstract: Deep learning models for Time Series Classification (TSC) have achieved strong predictive performance but their high computational and memory requirements often limit deployment on resource-constrained devices. While structured pruning can address these issues by removing redundant filters, existing methods typically rely on manually tuned hyperparameters such as pruning ratios which limit scalability and generalization across datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm that DSP produces compact and informative representations, offering a practical path for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment.

Abstract: The successor representation (SR) provides a powerful framework for decoupling predictive dynamics from rewards, enabling rapid generalisation across reward configurations. However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.

Abstract: Telemetry-Aware routing promises to increase efficacy and responsiveness to traffic surges in computer networks. Recent research leverages Machine Learning to deal with the complex dependency between network state and routing, but sacrifices explainability of routing decisions due to the black-box nature of the proposed neural routing modules. We propose \emph{Placer}, a novel algorithm using Message Passing Networks to transform network states into latent node embeddings. These embeddings facilitate quick greedy next-hop routing without directly solving the all-pairs shortest paths problem, and let us visualize how certain network events shape routing decisions.

Abstract: Predicting future clinical events from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to sparse multi-type clinical events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate when reasoning over long structured histories. We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.

Abstract: Iterative generative policies, such as diffusion models and flow matching, offer superior expressivity for continuous control but complicate Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has established itself as the dominant paradigm for instilling rigorous reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a "Normalization Squeeze," where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Wake vortices are strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft, and they pose a major safety and capacity challenge for air traffic management. Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks often produces task-specific parameter updates that are expensive to relearn for every model variant. While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically.

Abstract: We propose the Variation Calibration Error (VCE) metric for assessing the calibration of machine learning classifiers. The metric can be viewed as an extension of the well-known Expected Calibration Error (ECE) which assesses the calibration of the maximum probability or confidence. Other ways of measuring the variation of a probability distribution exist which have the advantage of taking into account the full probability distribution, for example the Shannon entropy. We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature.

Abstract: In today's digital world, the generation of vast amounts of streaming data in various domains has become ubiquitous. However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Satellite-derived data products and climate model simulations of geophysical variables like precipitation, often exhibit systematic biases compared to in-situ measurements. Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed MAUNet-Light.The proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The recently proposed fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has demonstrated significant advantages in correlation characterization and transpositional invariance, and has achieved notable achievements in multi-dimensional data processing and analysis. However, existing multi-dimensional data recovery methods leveraging FCTN decomposition still have room for further enhancement, particularly in computational efficiency and modeling capability. To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework. Theoretical results on approximation error upper bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed method are derived. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and running time.

Abstract: Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.

Abstract: Accurate production forecasts are essential to continue facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation. Moreover, the findings suggest that the use of an ensemble of weather forecasts can improve point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable equations from observational data, with the potential to reveal underlying principles behind natural phenomena. However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.

Abstract: Wearable e-textile interfaces require gesture recognition capabilities but face severe constraints in power consumption, computational capacity, and form factor that make traditional deep learning impractical. While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$μ$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies. These results demonstrate how convex optimization can enable efficient on-device machine learning for textile interfaces.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains large language models (LLMs) from sampled trajectories, making decoding strategy a core component of learning rather than a purely inference-time choice. Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to optimize decision-making policies under constraint conditions, making it highly applicable to safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and power grid management. However, existing robust CRL approaches predominantly focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations. To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.

Abstract: While historical considerations surrounding text authenticity revolved primarily around plagiarism, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new challenge: distinguishing human-authored from AI-generated text. This shift raises significant concerns, including the undermining of skill evaluations, the mass-production of low-quality content, and the proliferation of misinformation. Addressing these issues, we introduce GPTZero a state-of-the-art industrial AI detection solution, offering reliable discernment between human and LLM-generated text. Our key contributions include: introducing a hierarchical, multi-task architecture enabling a flexible taxonomy of human and AI texts, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on a variety of domains with granular predictions, and achieving superior robustness to adversarial attacks and paraphrasing via multi-tiered automated red teaming. GPTZero offers accurate and explainable detection, and educates users on its responsible use, ensuring fair and transparent assessment of text.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification presents a formidable challenge in machine learning, particularly when tabular datasets are plagued by noise and overlapping class boundaries. From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) are increasingly regarded as a core intelligence engine for embodied AI applications. However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly depend on continual learning to adapt to non-stationary environments. These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving personalization of large language models, but mobile devices impose severe memory constraints, typically 6--12GB shared across all workloads. Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Mobility trajectory data provide essential support for smart city applications. However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.

Abstract: Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\times$ speedup with less than 2\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.

Abstract: Graph pre-training has achieved remarkable success in recent years, delivering transferable representations for downstream adaptation. However, most existing methods are designed for either homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs, thereby hindering unified graph modeling across diverse graph types. This separation contradicts real-world applications, where mixed homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous, and distribution shifts between upstream pre-training and downstream deployment are common. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \textbf{G}raph \textbf{P}re-training method across \textbf{H}omogeneous and \textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths. Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that $\text{GPH}^{2}$ enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly improved time series classification, yet the lack of explainability in these models remains a major challenge. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.

Abstract: Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Gengsheng-Li/R-Diverse.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a low-complexity and energy-efficient alternative to traditional full-precision neural networks by constraining their weights and activations to binary values. However, their discrete, highly non-linear behavior makes them difficult to explain, validate and formally verify. As a result, BNNs remain largely opaque, limiting their suitability in safety-critical domains, where causal transparency and behavioral guarantees are essential. In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By "eventizing" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft. Overall, this framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification.

Abstract: Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) potentials such as SchNet improve the accuracy and transferability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by learning many-body interactions, but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.

Abstract: Partial differential equations often contain unknown functions that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, hampering our ability to derive predictions from the model. Workflows for recovering scalar PDE parameters from data are well studied: here we show how similar workflows can be used to recover functions from data. Specifically, we embed neural networks into the PDE and show how, as they are trained on data, they can approximate unknown functions with arbitrary accuracy. Using nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations as a case study, we recover interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data. Specifically, we investigate how a wide range of factors, such as the number of available solutions, their properties, sampling density, and measurement noise, affect our ability to successfully recover functions. Our approach is advantageous because it can utilise standard parameter-fitting workflows, and in that the trained PDE can be treated as a normal PDE for purposes such as generating system predictions.
