Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and
human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing
access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster
response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a
framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental
signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is
structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution,
which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response
planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and
operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and
proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across
vulnerable mountainous terrains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/BaoquanGong/Multimodal-Negative-Learning.git.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks

\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central
library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse
architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility
and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and
Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level
recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and
LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and
extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and
experimentation. All packages are available under the MIT license and actively

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular

transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to

correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in
computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this
problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative
Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations
like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While
previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a
quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we
provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF
under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal
distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results
encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another
where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction
results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical
guarantees for DSBM.

Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model
robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing
methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their
application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space
perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner
maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized
estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the
underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed
formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient
optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide
generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We
also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation
shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications
of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when
multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups
increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity
problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness
which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample
sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce
a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral
Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial
learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate
fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing
supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper
bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in
benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is
large so that many subgroups are very small.

Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable
decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,
defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression
remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate
calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,
which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to
univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,
we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to
enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank
functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest
density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces
calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral
transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a
regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.
Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both
marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new
PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal
variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality
reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that
unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods
significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without
sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a
subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes
the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability
is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle
queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks
that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret
guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also
propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for
improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.
Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in
time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific
applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability
distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical
challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood
computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering
them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce
$\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel
non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal
Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number
of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a
significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our
framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based
architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training
BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling
and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our
theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$
speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for
high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational
bottlenecks.

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for
black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a
weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is
proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can
model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them
for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do
this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with
auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a
Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field
theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,
$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial
latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples
which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.
Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the
exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each
iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match
the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn
from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic
program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge
exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by
evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target
distributions.
