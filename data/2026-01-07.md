Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees. All implementations, benchmarks, and proofs are available at https://github.com/Ajwebdevs/Chronicals with pip installation via https://pypi.org/project/chronicals/.

Abstract: Digital AI systems spanning large language models, vision models, and generative architectures that operate primarily in symbolic, linguistic, or pixel domains. They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The synthetic control (SC) framework is widely used for observational causal inference with time-series panel data. SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-γ)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable empirical success in the recent years and are considered one of the state-of-the-art generative models in modern AI. These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.

Abstract: Foundation vision, audio, and language models enable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks via their latent representations. Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.

Abstract: Following the initial publication of hdlib, a Python library for designing Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), we introduce a major extension that significantly enhances its machine learning capabilities. VSA, also known as Hyperdimensional Computing, is a computing paradigm that represents and processes information using high-dimensional vectors. While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib). Documentation and examples of these new features are available on the official Wiki at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib/wiki.

Abstract: The rapid growth of dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools calls for systems that not only demonstrate empirical performance but also provide strong theoretical guarantees. Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective. This research constitutes a theoretical and practical leap for deep dermatological diagnostics, thereby opening the machine learning theory clinical applicability interface.

Abstract: Credit risk assessment is essential in the financial sector, but has traditionally depended on costly feature-based models that often fail to utilize all available information in raw credit records. This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability. Evaluation on real-world data further demonstrates its strong potential in accurate and efficient risk assessment. LendNova establishes a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in this domain. It lays the groundwork for future research toward foundation systems that enable more accurate, adaptable, and automated financial decision-making.

Abstract: The accelerated development of social media websites has posed intricate security issues in cyberspace, where these sites have increasingly become victims of criminal activities including attempts to intrude into them, abnormal traffic patterns, and organized attacks. The conventional rule-based security systems are not always scalable and dynamic to meet such a threat. This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.

Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.

Abstract: Financial institutions and regulators require systems that integrate heterogeneous data to assess risks from stock fluctuations to systemic vulnerabilities. Existing approaches often treat these tasks in isolation, failing to capture cross-scale dependencies. We propose Uni-FinLLM, a unified multimodal large language model that uses a shared Transformer backbone and modular task heads to jointly process financial text, numerical time series, fundamentals, and visual data. Through cross-modal attention and multi-task optimization, it learns a coherent representation for micro-, meso-, and macro-level predictions. Evaluated on stock forecasting, credit-risk assessment, and systemic-risk detection, Uni-FinLLM significantly outperforms baselines. It raises stock directional accuracy to 67.4% (from 61.7%), credit-risk accuracy to 84.1% (from 79.6%), and macro early-warning accuracy to 82.3%.

Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Rotary positional embedding has become the state-of-the-art approach to encode position information in transformer-based models. While it is often succinctly expressed in complex linear algebra, we note that the actual implementation of $Q/K/V$-projections is not equivalent to a complex linear transformation. We argue that complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization and saves near 50\% parameters within the attention block. We show empirically that removing such redundancy has negligible impact on the model performance both in sample and out of sample. Our modification achieves more efficient parameter usage, as well as a cleaner interpretation of the representation space.

Abstract: Tree ensemble methods such as Random Forests naturally induce supervised similarity measures through their decision tree structure, but existing implementations of proximities derived from tree ensembles typically suffer from quadratic time or memory complexity, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a general framework for efficient proximity computation by defining a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities. We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons. This formulation enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation using sparse linear algebra in Python. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.

Abstract: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.

Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.

Motivation: 由于跨井和环境条件的变化导致时间序列数据分布漂移，需开发能跨域迁移的回归模型以稳定预测SSI，降低钻井过程中的振动风险。

Conclusion: 基于域泛化的方法在钻井时间序列建模中具有潜力，ADG在该任务中最具效果，TL进一步提升了跨井泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of domain generalization techniques applied to time series data within a drilling context, focusing on the prediction of a continuous Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional downhole vibrations at the drill bit. The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach.

Abstract: Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.

Abstract: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI safety, yet remains a persistent challenge. Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%). By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, our method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification.

Abstract: Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is critical for ride-hailing platforms, where errors directly impact user experience and operational efficiency. While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency. Furthermore, an asynchronous incremental learning strategy is tailored to enable real-time and stable adaptation to dynamic traffic distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world datasets validate MixTTE significantly reduces prediction errors compared to seven baselines. MixTTE has been deployed in DiDi, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of the TTE service.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.

Abstract: Recent work by Anthropic on Mechanistic interpretability claims to understand and control Large Language Models by extracting human-interpretable features from their neural activation patterns using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.

Abstract: Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large language model conditioned on rich user personas, combined with an expert programmatic engine, generates diverse, rule-consistent synthetic transaction data; produced a 30M-transaction dataset from 23k users with benchmarks for illiquidity and identity theft detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address strict privacy regulations that hinder real transaction research; existing synthetic methods struggle to combine behavioral diversity with strict financial constraints and privacy preservation.

Method: LLM conditioned on rich user personas interacts in a closed loop with a rule-based engine that updates user state, enforces financial constraints, and returns a context-aware nextprompt to steer the LLM; an expert programmable engine ensures correctness and rule compliance; generates logs, code, and rules.

Result: Public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users; benchmark suite for illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation; provides a privacy-preserving, realistic resource for evaluating forecasting and anomaly detection models; code, rules, and generation logs released.

Conclusion: PersonaLedger enables rigorous, reproducible evaluation of financial AI models by offering a realistic, privacy-preserving synthetic dataset and accompanying benchmarks, along with the generation tooling and logs to reproduce and extend work.

Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning.

Abstract: Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.

Abstract: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, yet its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of decentralization of autoregressive generation. We define the Decentralized Discrete Flow Matching objective, by expressing probability generating velocity as a linear combination of expert flows. We also conduct experiments demonstrat- ing the equivalence between decentralized and centralized training settings for multimodal language models across diverse set of benchmarks. Specifically, we compare two distinct paradigms: LLaVA and InternVL 2.5-1B, which uses a fixed CLIP vision encoder and per- forms full-parameter fine-tuning (ViT+MLP+LLM) during the instruction tuning stage.

Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.
  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.
  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.

Abstract: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.

Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解 LTD 的偏差问题，提升工业场景下的异常检测性能，且不依赖于正常数据的先验类别信息，适用于多种数据类型。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in industrial applications for identifying rare and unseen patterns to ensure system reliability. Traditional models, trained on a single class of normal data, struggle with real-world distributions where normal data exhibit diverse patterns, leading to class imbalance and long-tailed anomaly score distributions (LTD). This imbalance skews model training and degrades detection performance, especially for minority instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel importance-weighted loss designed specifically for anomaly detection. Compared to the previous method for LTD in classification, our method does not require prior knowledge of normal data classes. Instead, we introduce a weighted loss function that incorporates importance sampling to align the distribution of anomaly scores with a target Gaussian, ensuring a balanced representation of normal data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets and three real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach in mitigating LTD-induced bias. Our method improves anomaly detection performance by 0.043, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce Conformal Interquantile Regression (CIR), a conformal regression method that efficiently constructs near-minimal prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. CIR leverages black-box machine learning models to estimate outcome distributions through interquantile ranges, transforming these estimates into compact prediction intervals while achieving approximate conditional coverage. We further propose CIR+ (Conditional Interquantile Regression with More Comparison), which enhances CIR by incorporating a width-based selection rule for interquantile intervals. This refinement yields narrower prediction intervals while maintaining comparable coverage, though at the cost of slightly increased computational time. Both methods address key limitations of existing distributional conformal prediction approaches: they handle skewed distributions more effectively than Conformalized Quantile Regression, and they achieve substantially higher computational efficiency than Conformal Histogram Regression by eliminating the need for histogram construction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods optimally balance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Many important problems in science and engineering involve inferring a signal from noisy and/or incomplete observations, where the observation process is known. Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from examples of ground-truth signals and associated observations. However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems.
