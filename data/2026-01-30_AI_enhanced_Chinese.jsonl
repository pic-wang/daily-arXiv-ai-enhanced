Latent-IMH first generates intermediate latent variables using the approximate $\\tilde{A}$, and then refines them using the exact $A$. Its primary benefit is that it shifts the computational cost to an offline phase. We theoretically analyze the performance of Latent-IMH using KL divergence and mixing time bounds. Using numerical experiments on several model problems, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency.

To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of VISTA, yielding notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of base learners.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While they are usually parameterized by the score, an alternative way is to use a series of time-dependent energy-based models (EBMs), where the score is obtained from the negative input-gradient of the energy. Crucially, EBMs can be leveraged not only for generation, but also for tasks such as compositional sampling or building Boltzmann Generators via Monte Carlo methods. However, training EBMs remains challenging. Direct maximum likelihood is computationally prohibitive due to the need for nested sampling, while score matching, though efficient, suffers from mode blindness. To address these issues, we introduce the Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) objective, a simple method that avoids blindness while remaining computationally efficient. DiffCLF reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, and can be seamlessly combined with standard score-based objectives. We validate the effectiveness of DiffCLF by comparing the estimated energies against ground truth in analytical Gaussian mixture cases, and by applying the trained models to tasks such as model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling.

Boltzmann Generators (BGs) tackle it by combining a generative model with a Monte Carlo (MC) correction step to obtain asymptotically unbiased samples from an unnormalized target. Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost. Finally, in the learned-DM setting, all DM-aMC variants struggle to produce accurate BGs; we trace the main bottleneck to inaccurate DM log-density estimation.", "AI": {"tldr":

Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work critically examines the sufficiency of these standard metrics. We demonstrate that the interval length might be deceptively improved through a counter-intuitive approach termed Prejudicial Trick (PT), while the coverage remains valid. Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks.

More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \\emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise.

After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\\sqrt\u03c1$, where $\u03c1$ is the joint entry retention probability.

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\\widetilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1MDP\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u61d2\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0Q-learning\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u540c\u6b65/\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08~\u03b5^-2\uff09\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1MDP\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4fBellman\u7b97\u5b50\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5236\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u61d2\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u505c\u7559\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u534a\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u534a\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7ecf\u61d2\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684Bellman\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u9636\u6536\u7f29\uff1b\u5bf9\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u5f02\u6b65Q-learning\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728 reachability \u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u4f53\u7684Q-learning\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0 \tilde{O}(\u03b5^{-2}) \u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u534a\u8303\u6570\u4e0e\u61d2\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u4f7f\u5f97Bellman\u7b97\u5b50\u5177\u5907\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u61d2\u5316MDP\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u534a\u8303\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1MDP\u7684Q-learning\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e14\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent.

Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP is inversely proportional to $\u03b4$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on R\u00e9nyi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds.

However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level.

Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \\textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$.

In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u534a\u5f84\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0MLIP\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9MACE\u3001Nequip\u3001OrbV3\u3001TensorNet\u7b49\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea62.26x\u5185\u5b58\u548c2.04x\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMLIP\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u622a\u65ad\u534a\u5f84\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u7684MLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6309\u6bcf\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u90bb\u5c45\u6570\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff1b\u5c06\u8be5\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41MLIP\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u5b9e\u73b02.26x\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\u3001\u7ea62.04x\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5c0f\uff1b\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u4e3aMLIP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure.

While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d/\\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $\u03ba= \\mathcal O(\\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\\sqrt{T})$.

While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This stems from a critical \"reasoning horizon gap\": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching.

Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks.

Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models.

Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution.

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \\emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \\textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \\emph{sparse observations} and \\emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss.

In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework.

Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting.

In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DUET\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u201c\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u201d\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u6559\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u4eff\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u904f\u5236\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3001\u5bf9\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u8c03\u4f18\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6DUET\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u62d2\u7edd\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u8be5\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f3a\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6216\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDUET\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "DUET\u6210\u529f\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u5927\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u601d\u8def\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u84b8\u998f\u578b\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance.

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset.

In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off.

We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch.

A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedGALA aligns graph and language modalities in federated settings by unsupervised contrastive learning between GNNs and frozen PLMs in a continuous embedding space, plus prompt-based tuning for efficient adaptation, achieving superior performance with reduced communication and without full-parameter fine-tuning.", "motivation": "The study tackles the combined challenges of federated graph foundation models: data distribution heterogeneity, privacy constraints, knowledge loss from vector quantization, and the need to reconcile semantic-structural information between PLMs and GNNs to enable effective knowledge transfer.", "method": "Unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNN encoders with frozen PLMs in a shared continuous embedding space, followed by communication-efficient prompt tuning to adapt to downstream tasks without full-parameter fine-tuning, within a federated, privacy-preserving setting.", "result": "Empirical evaluation shows FedGALA outperforms competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets and tasks, with up to 14.37% performance improvement.", "conclusion": "FedGALA effectively resolves semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between PLMs and GNNs in federated graph learning, enabling robust, transferable knowledge while reducing communication overhead and avoiding full model fine-tuning."}}

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format.

Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability.

The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding.

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \\method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "L^3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u805a\u5408\u4e00\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u4e14\u53efCPU\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MoE\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u800c\u635f\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Large Lookup Layer (L^3)\uff0c\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u4e00\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u4f53\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cCPU\u79bb\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u65e0\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u591a\u8fbe26\u4ebf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\u7684Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cL^3\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u7684MoE\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0cL^3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u7a00\u758fMoE\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate.

These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search.

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior.

Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed.

Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations.

A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain.

We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set.

Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets.

In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC.

For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear.

While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) \u53d6\u4ee3\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TCL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5355\u5143\u7684 Repository-Centric Experience \u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e92\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa repo \u7279\u5316\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6 SWE-Spot-4B\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879 SWE \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u80a9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4ee5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TCL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6a2a\u5411\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u591a\u4ed3\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\uff08\u201c\u73af\u5883\u7269\u7406\u201d\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u6765\u5185\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Repository-Centric Learning (RCL) \u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a2a\u5411\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u5355\u5143\u7684 Repository-Centric Experience\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa SWE-Spot-4B \u5bb6\u65cf\u7684 repo \u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u638c\u63e1\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u7684\u201c\u7269\u7406\u201d\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879 SWE \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSWE-Spot-4B \u76f8\u6bd4\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 CWM by Meta\u3001Qwen3-Coder-30B\uff09\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 GPT-4.1-mini\u3001GPT-5-nano\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ed3\u5e93\u638c\u63e1\uff08repository mastery\uff09\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u3002RCL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9762\u5411\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes.

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.\n  We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs.

Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \\textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \\textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline.

Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space.

The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training.

Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "PIDM \u901a\u8fc7\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9006\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0cPIDM \u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4 BC \u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u57282D\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBC \u9700\u8981\u591a\u8fbe5\u500d\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u7ea63\u500d\uff09\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e PIDM \u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef43D\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cBC \u7684\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u8d85\u51fa PIDM \u768466%\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0cBC \u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u4f8b\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5f15\u5165 PIDM \u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e IDM\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 PIDM \u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u603b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u628a IDM \u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b PIDM \u76f8\u5bf9 BC \u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ef43D\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f PIDM \u76f8\u5bf9 BC \u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3001\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u57282D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBC \u9700\u591a\u51fa\u81f3\u591a5\u500d\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5e73\u57473\u500d\uff09\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u76843D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cBC \u7684\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u6bd4 PIDM \u591a\u51fa\u8d85\u8fc766%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPIDM \u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u8868\u660e PIDM \u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76f8\u8f83 BC \u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002"}}

We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass.

As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters.

Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to \"flatten\" the data.

However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs.

This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention.

To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality.

We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors.

Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility.

Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity.

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives.

This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm.
