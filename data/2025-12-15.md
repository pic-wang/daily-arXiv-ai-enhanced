TL;DR: STARK 提出一种在 ultra-low sequencing depth 下进行空间转录组图像去噪的方法，通过自适应图拉普拉斯正则化的核岭回归实现，迭代更新图结构以提升鲁棒性并可对基因表达进行插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低测序深度条件下，捕获细胞身份和空间表达模式极具挑战性。通过结合核岭回归与自适应图正则化，STARK 旨在在噪声高、数据稀疏的情形下提升去噪效果并实现表达水平的插值。

Method: 在每次迭代中，先使用固定图的核岭回归更新图像，再基于新图像更新图结构。核岭回归通过改良的表示定理将无限维问题化为有限维。初始仅用纯空间图，随着图像的改进逐步更新图，以增强对低深度噪声的鲁棒性。目标函数呈现块凸结构，通过交替最小化分解为闭式解的子问题并收敛到一个稳定点。理论上，稳定点的风险收敛速率为 O(R^{-1/2})，R 为读取次数。

Result: 在真实空间转录组数据的数值实验中，STARK 的去噪在标签转移准确度方面相较于对比方法表现出一致的提升。

Conclusion: STARK 提供了一种在 ultra-low depth 场景下可靠去噪与基因表达插值的框架，利用自适应图正则化与核岭回归的结合，具备理论收敛性与实证优势。

Abstract: We present an approach to denoising spatial transcriptomics images that is particularly effective for uncovering cell identities in the regime of ultra-low sequencing depths, and also allows for interpolation of gene expression. The method -- Spatial Transcriptomics via Adaptive Regularization and Kernels (STARK) -- augments kernel ridge regression with an incrementally adaptive graph Laplacian regularizer. In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed. This perspective allows us to prove convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of this non-convex objective. Statistically, such stationary points converge to the ground truth with rate $\mathcal{O}(R^{-1/2})$ where $R$ is the number of reads. In numerical experiments on real spatial transcriptomics data, the denoising performance of STARK, evaluated in terms of label transfer accuracy, shows consistent improvement over the competing methods tested.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: WeldNet 提出了一种基于窗口化自编码器的非线性模型降维框架，通过在重叠时间窗口内学习低维表征并训练传播器与跨窗口转编码器来建模动态，实验显示优于传统线性投影与其他非线性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理高维时间依赖性系统的昂贵数值仿真；传统线性或单一全局降维在强非线性和长时标记下表现不足；在若干重叠时间窗口内进行局部非线性降维并通过传播器学习演化，有助于提高近似质量并降低训练难度；并在理论层面基于流形假设给出表示能力的论证。

Method: 将时间域分成多个重叠窗口，在每个窗口内使用自编码器进行非线性降维得到潜在码；训练传播器以捕获潜在码在各窗口内的演化；训练跨窗口的转编码器以连接相邻窗口的潜在码，确保跨窗口一致性；提供关于在流形假设下 WeldNet 表示能力的数理理论；在若干微分方程问题上进行数值实验比较。

Result: WeldNet 能捕捉到非线性潜在结构及其动力学，相较传统投影法和其他非线性降维方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 窗口化分解简化了传播器的训练并提高了一致性，理论与实验共同支撑 WeldNet 在复杂演化系统的非线性模型降维中的有效性与可行性。

Abstract: Many problems in science and engineering involve time-dependent, high dimensional datasets arising from complex physical processes, which are costly to simulate. In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study outlier (a.k.a., anomaly) detection for single-pass non-stationary streaming data. In the well-studied offline or batch outlier detection problem, traditional methods such as kernel One-Class SVM (OCSVM) are both computationally heavy and prone to large false-negative (Type II) errors under non-stationarity. To remedy this, we introduce SONAR, an efficient SGD-based OCSVM solver with strongly convex regularization. We show novel theoretical guarantees on the Type I/II errors of SONAR, superior to those known for OCSVM, and further prove that SONAR ensures favorable lifelong learning guarantees under benign distribution shifts. In the more challenging problem of adversarial non-stationary data, we show that SONAR can be used within an ensemble method and equipped with changepoint detection to achieve adaptive guarantees, ensuring small Type I/II errors on each phase of data. We validate our theoretical findings on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Feature and Interaction Importance (FII) methods are essential in supervised learning for assessing the relevance of input variables and their interactions in complex prediction models. In many domains, such as personalized medicine, local interpretations for individual predictions are often required, rather than global scores summarizing overall feature importance. Random Forests (RFs) are widely used in these settings, and existing interpretability methods typically exploit tree structures and split statistics to provide model-specific insights. However, theoretical understanding of local FII methods for RF remains limited, making it unclear how to interpret high importance scores for individual predictions. We propose a novel, local, model-specific FII method that identifies frequent co-occurrences of features along decision paths, combining global patterns with those observed on paths specific to a given test point. We prove that our method consistently recovers the true local signal features and their interactions under a Locally Spike Sparse (LSS) model and also identifies whether large or small feature values drive a prediction. We illustrate the usefulness of our method and theoretical results through simulation studies and a real-world data example.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We identify test prediction variance (TPV) -- the first-order sensitivity of model outputs to parameter perturbations around a trained solution -- as a unifying quantity that links several classical observations about generalization in deep networks. TPV is a fully label-free object whose trace form separates the geometry of the trained model from the specific perturbation mechanism, allowing a broad family of parameter perturbations like SGD noise, label noise, finite-precision noise, and other post-training perturbations to be analyzed under a single framework. Theoretically, we show that TPV estimated on the training set converges to its test-set value in the overparameterized limit, providing the first result that prediction variance under local parameter perturbations can be inferred from training inputs alone. Empirically, TPV exhibits a striking stability across datasets and architectures -- including extremely narrow networks -- and correlates well with clean test loss. Finally, we demonstrate that modeling pruning as a TPV perturbation yields a simple label-free importance measure that performs competitively with state-of-the-art pruning methods, illustrating the practical utility of TPV.

### [6] [Conditional Coverage Diagnostics for Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11779)
*Sacha Braun,David Holzmüller,Michael I. Jordan,Francis Bach*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一个新颖的条件覆盖评估框架 ERT，将条件覆盖问题转化为分类任务，通过损失函数得到风险差，提供对过/欠覆盖的保守估计，并提升统计功效，附带开源实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的条件覆盖评估多依赖边际覆盖的保证，难以诊断局部的条件覆盖偏差；现有指标（如 CovGap）样本效率低、易过拟合，难以提供稳定的局部诊断与对不同方法的公平比较。

Method: 将条件覆盖 violations 等价于若存在一个分类器能以比目标覆盖更低的风险完成预测，则条件覆盖被违反。通过选取恰当的损失函数，风险差成为对自然不覆盖（如 L1/L2 距离）的保守估计，且可分离过覆盖与欠覆盖，以及非恒定目标覆盖；命名为 Excess Risk of Target Coverage（ERT），并通过现代分类器提升统计功效。

Result: 实验证明相较于简单分类器，现代分类器提供更高的统计功效；ERT 能够区分不同类型的覆盖偏差并用于基准对比不同的 conformal prediction 方法。

Conclusion: ERT 为理解、诊断并改进条件可靠性提供了新的分析视角，并附带开源实现，便于学术和工程社区使用和扩展。

Abstract: Evaluating conditional coverage remains one of the most persistent challenges in assessing the reliability of predictive systems. Although conformal methods can give guarantees on marginal coverage, no method can guarantee to produce sets with correct conditional coverage, leaving practitioners without a clear way to interpret local deviations. To overcome sample-inefficiency and overfitting issues of existing metrics, we cast conditional coverage estimation as a classification problem. Conditional coverage is violated if and only if any classifier can achieve lower risk than the target coverage. Through the choice of a (proper) loss function, the resulting risk difference gives a conservative estimate of natural miscoverage measures such as L1 and L2 distance, and can even separate the effects of over- and under-coverage, and non-constant target coverages. We call the resulting family of metrics excess risk of the target coverage (ERT). We show experimentally that the use of modern classifiers provides much higher statistical power than simple classifiers underlying established metrics like CovGap. Additionally, we use our metric to benchmark different conformal prediction methods. Finally, we release an open-source package for ERT as well as previous conditional coverage metrics. Together, these contributions provide a new lens for understanding, diagnosing, and improving the conditional reliability of predictive systems.

### [7] [Scalable Data Synthesis for Computer Use Agents with Step-Level Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10962)
*Yifei He,Pranit Chawla,Yaser Souri,Subhojit Som,Xia Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出逐步筛选的自监督数据合成管线，将嘈杂的CUA rollout 转化为高质量监督，构建 WebSTAR/WebSCORE 数据集，并训练更强的 CUA 模型与轻量化奖励模型 StepRM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多依赖人类演示，获取成本高且不易扩展；从强CUA生成的数据往往噪声多，直接模仿效果差，需有效的数据清洗与标注策略。

Method: 提出逐步筛选（step-level filtering）与推理增强（reasoning augmentation）的数据合成管线，将逐步动作逐条评估并筛除错误步骤，随后训练强CUA模型（Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct 7B/32B），并构建大型数据集 WebSTAR（13.3K 轨迹，100K 步骤）以及 WebSCORE（带分级的步骤级动作），同时训练轻量化奖励模型 StepRM（7B，多模态），以实现可扩展的质量评估。

Result: 在 WebVoyager 上，7B 模型超越开源最先进的 UI-CUA 模型 UI-TARS-1.5-7B 超过 15% 以上（仅监督微调）。WebSTAR 包含 13.3K 条轨迹与 100K 分级步骤，StepRM 的分级质量与更大模型等效，同时具备更高部署效率。

Conclusion: 逐步筛选是可扩展 CUA 训练的关键原则；提供 WebSTAR、WebSCORE 数据集与 StepRM 等实用工具，推动鲁棒且高效的 CUAs 的发展。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) can operate real-world digital interfaces but remain difficult to train due to the high cost of graphical user interface (GUI) interaction and the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can benefit from integrating complementary information from multiple modalities, mirroring clinical practice. However, conventional fusion approaches often rely on simple concatenation of features, which cannot adaptively balance the contributions of biomarkers such as amyloid PET and MRI across brain regions. In this work, we propose MREF-AD, a Multimodal Regional Expert Fusion model for AD diagnosis. It is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that models meso-scale brain regions in each modality as an independent expert and employs two-level gating networks to learn subject-specific fusion weights. Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), MREF-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines while providing enhanced interpretability of brain region-specific biomarker relevance, underscoring its utility as a general framework for adaptive and interpretable multimodal fusion in neuroimaging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have demonstrated remarkable success in scaling neural networks, yet their application to continual learning remains fundamentally limited by a critical vulnerability: the learned gating network itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Mixture of Bidders (MoB), a novel framework that reconceptualizes expert routing as a decentralized economic mechanism. MoB replaces learned gating networks with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, where experts compete for each data batch by bidding their true cost -- a principled combination of execution cost (predicted loss) and forgetting cost (Elastic Weight Consolidation penalty). This game-theoretic approach provides three key advantages: (1) {stateless routing that is immune to catastrophic forgetting, (2) \textbf{truthful bidding} guaranteed by dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, and (3) emergent specialization without explicit task boundaries. On Split-MNIST benchmarks, MoB achieves 88.77% average accuracy compared to 19.54% for Gated MoE and 27.96% for Monolithic EWC, representing a 4.5 times improvement over the strongest baseline. We further extend MoB with autonomous self-monitoring experts that detect their own knowledge consolidation boundaries, eliminating the need for explicit task demarcation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在败血症患者中，个体化抗凝治疗复杂且评估指标需更细粒度表示，现有方法缺乏连续状态与稳健评估工具。本研究提出用连续评分和 TECM 提升治疗策略的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用 MIMIC-IV v1.0 与 eICU v2.0 数据集；训练队列为腹部手术患者，术后败血症发作后接受 UFH；将 SOFA 转换为连续 cxSOFA；用 stepwise 确定“好”/“坏”策略；提出 TECM 作为治疗策略评估矩阵；比较 Q-Learning、DQN、DDQN、BCQ、CQL 等 RL 算法。

Result: cxSOFA-CQL 在所有模型中表现最佳，死亡率由 1.83% 降低至 0.74%，平均住院日从 11.11 天降至 9.42 天；TECM 在各模型下表现一致，表明鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的 RL 框架实现对肝素治疗的可解释、鲁棒优化，并借助连续 cxSOFA 与 TECM 提供更细致的治疗评估，具有提升临床结局和决策支持可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to acute organ dysfunction. This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining "good" or "bad" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness. Conclusion: The proposed RL framework enables interpretable and robust optimization of heparin therapy in surgical sepsis. Continuous cxSOFA scoring and TECM-based evaluation provide nuanced treatment assessment, showing promise for improving clinical outcomes and decision-support reliability.

Abstract: Effective human-agent interaction (HAI) relies on accurate and adaptive perception of human emotional states. While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent. Our framework not only improves training efficiency but also contributes to the design of more flexible, scalable, and maintainable perception modules for embodied and virtual agents in HAI scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a machine/deep learning methodology to solve parametric integrals.

These examples range from smooth closed-form benchmarks to challenging numerical integrals. Across all cases, the differential machine learning-based approach consistently outperforms standard architectures, achieving lower mean squared error, enhanced scalability, and improved sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generating precise 3D molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and material science. While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that "sculpts" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/MolSculpt.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Even for the gradient descent (GD) method applied to neural network training, understanding its optimization dynamics, including convergence rate, iterate trajectories, function value oscillations, and especially its implicit acceleration, remains a challenging problem. We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments. We believe that this alternative view will further advance research on the optimization of neural networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Memoryless and finite-memory policies offer a practical alternative for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), as they operate directly in the output space rather than in the high-dimensional belief space. However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly. Across several POMDPs examples, our method achieves significant computational speedups over policy-gradient baselines and recent specialized algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network (NN) verifiers demonstrate that applying the branch-and-bound (BaB) procedure with fast bounding techniques plays a key role in tackling many challenging verification properties. In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $α,β$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner. Code available at https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/Clip_and_Verify.

Abstract: Label ambiguity is an inherent problem in real-world electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, arising from overlapping conditions and diagnostic disagreement. However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation at inference, yet its application to multimodal systems such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of inference time reasoning methods applied across both open-source and closed-source VLMs on different benchmarks. Our results reveal that while closed-source models consistently benefit from structured reasoning and iterative Self-Refinement, open-source VLMs show inconsistent behavior: external verification provides the most reliable gains, whereas iterative refinement often degrades performance. We further find that the effectiveness of TTS is dataset-dependent, yielding clear improvements on multi-step reasoning tasks but offering only limited gains on perception-focused benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that TTS is not a universal solution and must be tailored to both model capabilities and task characteristics, motivating future work on adaptive TTS strategies and multimodal reward models.

Abstract: Balancing competing objectives is omnipresent across disciplines, from drug design to autonomous systems. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task for uncovering patterns in data. While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs Möbius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations on $11$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeGBMS significantly outperforms conventional mean-shift clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: The DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problem is fundamental to power system operations, requiring rapid solutions for real-time grid management. While traditional optimization solvers provide optimal solutions, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale systems requiring frequent recalculations. Machine learning approaches offer promise for acceleration but often struggle with constraint satisfaction and cost optimality. We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\% to 130\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\% for nominal loads and below 3\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\% feasibility. Our framework bridges the gap between fast but approximate neural network predictions and optimal but slow numerical solvers, offering a practical solution for modern power systems with high renewable penetration requiring frequent dispatch updates.

Abstract: Time series forecasting predicts future values from past data. In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data. An anonymized GitHub repository with the implementation of Co-TSFA is provided and will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Fairness and action smoothness are two crucial considerations in many online optimization problems, but they have yet to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\to\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一套 principled 的工具箱，使得在大提示规模中研究 softmax 注意力的训练动力学和统计性质成为可能，且其分析结构在长提示条件下与线性注意力一致，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Softmax attention is a central component of transformer architectures, yet its nonlinear structure poses significant challenges for theoretical analysis. We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.

Conclusion: VL提供了一种物理信息光谱滤波的有效途径，且将学习问题从非凸优化转化为凸的最小二乘问题，具备边界数据外推能力，且对PDE问题具备显著优势。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for parameterizing physical fields, yet they often suffer from spectral bias and the computational expense of non-convex optimization. We introduce the Vekua Layer (VL), a differentiable spectral method grounded in the classical theory of Generalized Analytic Functions. By restricting the hypothesis space to the kernel of the governing differential operator -- specifically utilizing Harmonic and Fourier-Bessel bases -- the VL transforms the learning task from iterative gradient descent to a strictly convex least-squares problem solved via linear projection. We evaluate the VL against Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIRENs) on homogeneous elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our results demonstrate that the VL achieves machine precision ($\text{MSE} \approx 10^{-33}$) on exact reconstruction tasks and exhibits superior stability in the presence of incoherent sensor noise ($\text{MSE} \approx 0.03$), effectively acting as a physics-informed spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the VL enables "holographic" extrapolation of global fields from partial boundary data via analytic continuation, a capability absent in standard coordinate-based approximations.

Abstract: Analyzing and visualizing scientific ensemble datasets with high dimensionality and complexity poses significant challenges. Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.

Abstract: Modern cities are increasingly reliant on data-driven insights to support decision making in areas such as transportation, public safety and environmental impact. However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains. This research advances the goal of building data-informed urban systems in a scalable way, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in smart city analytics.

Abstract: Current benchmarks that test LLMs on static, already-solved problems (e.g., math word problems) effectively demonstrated basic capability acquisition. The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing "benchmarking" as a vehicle for scientific advancement.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning uses governing ordinary and/or partial differential equations to train neural networks to represent the solution field. Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU.

TL;DR: 提出一种梯度投影框架，在扩散模型训练中对受保护的概念性特征进行选择性“去记忆”处理。通过在反向传播阶段将梯度投影到感知特征嵌入的正交补空间，消除受保护属性对模型权重的影响，既降低敏感特征的记忆化，又尽量保持生成质量和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型存在记忆化风险，可能导致对敏感或专有特征的属性提取和再现；传统的去记忆/正则化方法在概念层面上未能系统性地排除受保护特征，简单丢弃含有敏感特征的数据会浪费大量有价值的训练数据。需要一种在概念层面进行选择性“去学习”的方法。

Method: 在反向传播阶段进行梯度投影，将每次梯度更新投影到受保护属性嵌入空间的正交补上，从而完全去除其对模型权重的影响。该框架可无缝整合到标准扩散模型训练流程，并可与现有防御互补。

Result: 在大量实验中，框架显著降低受保护特征的记忆化，同时尽量保持生成质量和语义保真度，对抗尝试提取信息的攻击者效果良好。

Conclusion: 将记忆控制重新表述为选择性学习的新范式，提供了更安全的IP保护和隐私保护的生成式AI训练路径。

Abstract: Memorization in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models poses significant security and intellectual property risks, enabling adversarial attribute extraction and the unauthorized reproduction of sensitive or proprietary features. While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.
  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.

Abstract: Addressing selection bias in latent variable causal discovery is important yet underexplored, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical tools: While various tools beyond basic conditional independencies have been developed to handle latent variables, none have been adapted for selection bias. We make an attempt by studying rank constraints, which, as a generalization to conditional independence constraints, exploits the ranks of covariance submatrices in linear Gaussian models. We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms. We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of such rank constraints. Using this tool, we demonstrate that the one-factor model, a classical latent variable model, can be identified under selection bias. Simulations and real-world experiments confirm the effectiveness of using our rank constraints.

Abstract: We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Lifelong deep learning (LDL) trains neural networks to learn sequentially across tasks while preserving prior knowledge. We propose Task-Aware Multi-Expert (TAME), a continual learning algorithm that leverages task similarity to guide expert selection and knowledge transfer. TAME maintains a pool of pretrained neural networks and activates the most relevant expert for each new task. A shared dense layer integrates features from the chosen expert to generate predictions. To reduce catastrophic forgetting, TAME uses a replay buffer that stores representative samples and embeddings from previous tasks and reuses them during training. An attention mechanism further prioritizes the most relevant stored information for each prediction. Together, these components allow TAME to adapt flexibly while retaining important knowledge across evolving task sequences. Experiments on binary classification tasks derived from CIFAR-100 show that TAME improves accuracy on new tasks while sustaining performance on earlier ones, highlighting its effectiveness in balancing adaptation and retention in lifelong learning settings.

Abstract: Time-series data is critical across many scientific and industrial domains, including environmental analysis, agriculture, transportation, and finance. However, mining insights from this data typically requires deep domain expertise, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Insight Miner}, a large-scale multimodal model (LMM) designed to generate high-quality, comprehensive time-series descriptions enriched with domain-specific knowledge. To facilitate this, we introduce \textbf{TS-Insights}\footnote{Available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}.}, the first general-domain dataset for time series and language alignment. TS-Insights contains 100k time-series windows sampled from 20 forecasting datasets. We construct this dataset using a novel \textbf{agentic workflow}, where we use statistical tools to extract features from raw time series before synthesizing them into coherent trend descriptions with GPT-4. Following instruction tuning on TS-Insights, Insight Miner outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal models, such as LLaVA \citep{liu2023llava} and GPT-4, in generating time-series descriptions and insights. Our findings suggest a promising direction for leveraging LMMs in time series analysis, and serve as a foundational step toward enabling LLMs to interpret time series as a native input modality.

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了对 ICL 的理论理解，提出了更普遍且更贴近实践的隐式权重更新视角，并为将来在大模型上的验证奠定基础。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) refers to the ability of a model to learn new tasks from examples in its input without any parameter updates. In contrast to previous theories of ICL relying on toy models and data settings, recently it has been shown that an abstraction of a transformer block can be seen as implicitly updating the weights of its feedforward network according to the context (Dherin et al., 2025). Here, we provide a simple generalisation of this result for (i) all sequence positions beyond the last, (ii) any transformer block beyond the first, and (iii) more realistic residual blocks including layer normalisation. We empirically verify our theory on simple in-context linear regression tasks and investigate the relationship between the implicit updates related to different tokens within and between blocks. These results help to bring the theory of Dherin et al. (2025) even closer to practice, with potential for validation on large-scale models.

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are critical components in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.

Abstract: Quantum computers have the possibility of a much reduced calculation load compared with classical computers in specific problems. Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are prevalent in real-world scenarios, where continuous structural changes induce catastrophic forgetting in graph neural networks (GNNs). While continual learning has been extended to dynamic graphs, existing methods overlook the effects of topological changes on existing nodes. To address it, we propose a novel framework for continual learning on dynamic graphs, named Condensation-Concatenation-based Continual Learning (CCC). Specifically, CCC first condenses historical graph snapshots into compact semantic representations while aiming to preserve the original label distribution and topological properties. Then it concatenates these historical embeddings with current graph representations selectively. Moreover, we refine the forgetting measure (FM) to better adapt to dynamic graph scenarios by quantifying the predictive performance degradation of existing nodes caused by structural updates. CCC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets in extensive experiments.

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools are widely adopted in FPGA-based domain-specific accelerator design. However, existing tools rely on fixed optimization strategies inherited from software compilations, limiting their effectiveness. Tailoring optimization strategies to specific designs requires deep semantic understanding, accurate hardware metric estimation, and advanced search algorithms -- capabilities that current approaches lack.
  We propose DAPO, a design structure-aware pass ordering framework that extracts program semantics from control and data flow graphs, employs contrastive learning to generate rich embeddings, and leverages an analytical model for accurate hardware metric estimation. These components jointly guide a reinforcement learning agent to discover design-specific optimization strategies. Evaluations on classic HLS designs demonstrate that our end-to-end flow delivers a 2.36 speedup over Vitis HLS on average.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion policies (EDPs) combine the generative expressivity of diffusion models with the strong generalization and sample efficiency afforded by geometric symmetries. While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Trust prediction provides valuable support for decision-making, risk mitigation, and system security enhancement. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.
  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that adversarial graphs, i.e., graphs with imperceptible perturbations, can cause deep graph models to fail on classification tasks. In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is important to ensure their behaviors align with human values, societal norms, and ethical principles. However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural representation learning that incorporates algebraic constraints inspired by Bhargava cubes from number theory. Traditional deep learning methods learn representations in unstructured latent spaces lacking interpretability and mathematical consistency. Our framework maps input data to constrained 3-dimensional latent spaces where embeddings are regularized to satisfy learned quadratic relationships derived from Bhargava's combinatorial structures. The architecture employs a differentiable auxiliary loss function operating independently of classification objectives, guiding models toward mathematically structured representations. We evaluate on MNIST, achieving 99.46% accuracy while producing interpretable 3D embeddings that naturally cluster by digit class and satisfy learned quadratic constraints. Unlike existing manifold learning approaches requiring explicit geometric supervision, our method imposes weak algebraic priors through differentiable constraints, ensuring compatibility with standard optimization. This represents the first application of number-theoretic constructs to neural representation learning, establishing a foundation for incorporating structured mathematical priors in neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce sliced ReLU attention, a new attention mechanism that departs structurally from both softmax and ReLU-based alternatives. Instead of applying a nonlinearity to pairwise dot products, we operate on one-dimensional projections of key--query differences and leverage sorting to obtain quasi-linear complexity. This construction yields a differentiable, non-symmetric kernel that can be computed in O(n log(n)) through a sorting procedure, making it suitable for very long contexts. Beyond computational benefits, the model retains strong theoretical expressive power: we establish two in-context expressivity results, previously known for softmax attention, showing that sliced ReLU attention preserves the ability to perform nontrivial sequence-to-sequence disentangling tasks and satisfies a contextual universal approximation property. Finally, we illustrate the potential practical interest of this kernel in small-scale experiments.

Abstract: While effective post-training integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), the optimal mechanism for utilizing expert trajectories remains unresolved. We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.

Abstract: Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

Abstract: Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) models combine several kernels in supervised and unsupervised settings to integrate multiple data representations or sources, each represented by a different kernel. MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the "elastic-net" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario. Crucially, ENMKL produces sparser, more interpretable models by selectively weighting correlated kernels.

Abstract: Generalizing a pretrained model to unseen datasets without retraining is an essential step toward a foundation model. However, achieving such cross-dataset, fully inductive inference is difficult in graph-structured data where feature spaces vary widely in both dimensionality and semantics. Any transformation in the feature space can easily violate the inductive applicability to unseen datasets, strictly limiting the design space of a graph model. In this work, we introduce the view space, a novel representational axis in which arbitrary graphs can be naturally encoded in a unified manner. We then propose Graph View Transformation (GVT), a node- and feature-permutation-equivariant mapping in the view space. GVT serves as the building block for Recurrent GVT, a fully inductive model for node representation learning. Pretrained on OGBN-Arxiv and evaluated on 27 node-classification benchmarks, Recurrent GVT outperforms GraphAny, the prior fully inductive graph model, by +8.93% and surpasses 12 individually tuned GNNs by at least +3.30%. These results establish the view space as a principled and effective ground for fully inductive node representation learning.

Motivation: Current mask-and-reconstruct pretraining on small brain regions yields representations sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, requiring heavy fine-tuning. There is a need for abstract, stable representations of brain dynamics that generalize across tasks and datasets.

Method: Introduce a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into tokens representing functional networks, combined with a self-distillation objective that enforces temporal stability. A training curriculum stabilizes learning from low signal-to-noise time series.

Result: Learned representations yield strong downstream performance with linear probes. Scaling analyses show that more unlabeled data improves out-of-distribution performance without domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of self-supervised learning for abstract brain dynamics representations, with robustness to noise and favorable scaling; opens avenues for phenotype prediction with limited labels and potential cross-task generalization.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series holds significant promise for predicting phenotypes related to disease and cognition. Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation.

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models generalize poorly, particularly when tasks require new compositions of skills or objects. We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In streaming scenarios, models must learn continuously, adapting to concept drifts without erasing previously acquired knowledge. However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: Learning controller parameters from closed-loop data has been shown to improve closed-loop performance. Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design.

Method: Learn a low-dimensional subspace of benign optimization trajectories from historical aggregates via spectral methods. Project incoming updates into this subspace, apply Krum-style selection in the compressed coordinates, and filter candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. No auxiliary data is required; privacy is preserved.

Result: Evaluated against eight baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet non-IID partitions (alpha=0.1). Over 56,000 training rounds, SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift) but shows limited advantage for label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates are spectrally indistinguishable from benign.

Conclusion: SpectralKrum shows promise under certain non-IID and Byzantine conditions and preserves privacy without extra data, but it is not universally robust; improvements are needed for attacks that render malicious updates spectrally indistinguishable.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) distributes model training across clients who retain their data locally, but this architecture exposes a fundamental vulnerability: Byzantine clients can inject arbitrarily corrupted updates that degrade or subvert the global model. While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.
  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.
  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.

Abstract: Coordinate-based neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for representing continuous physical fields, yet they face two fundamental pathologies: spectral bias, which hinders the learning of high-frequency dynamics, and the curse of dimensionality, which causes parameter explosion in discrete feature grids. We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations. This work establishes a new paradigm for memory-efficient, spectrally accurate scientific machine learning. The code is available at https://github.com/VladimerKhasia/vecua.

Motivation: 旨在提供一个统一且领域无关的度量，用于量化复杂系统中元素之间的相互作用、冗余与独立性，以便在增量性能的非重复序列中揭示结构。

Method: 多次以随机顺序添加元素，绘制每个元素相对于前序元素的边际贡献；在双变量贡献上形成L形模式的2D点云，以判定互动、独立或冗余；定义L-score作为从-1到+1的连续度量，区分协同、独立与冗余；通过双变量关系推断更高阶交互，且方法对度量无关，适用于任何性能可在非重复序列中增量评估的领域。

Result: 当两元素对呈现红利/贡献在添加顺序上的依赖时，会出现明确的L形拐角，冗余对仅首个贡献，协同对需要两者共同贡献，独立对呈现与顺序无关的分布。L-score提供连续量化，跨对的相对Arm比例揭示特征支配。尽管仅基于成对测量，三元及以上的高阶交互通过跨对关系自然显现。该方法对度量无关，具高度普适性。

Conclusion: 该工作提出的L-score与几何分析为揭示系统中交互结构提供统一、直观的框架，适用于各种域的增量性能评估，便于识别协同、独立与冗余关系及特征支配。

Abstract: Many systems exhibit complex interactions between their components: some features or actions amplify each other's effects, others provide redundant information, and some contribute independently. We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC). The method is metric--agnostic and broadly applicable to any domain where performance can be evaluated incrementally over non-repeating element sequences, providing a unified geometric approach to uncovering interaction structure.
