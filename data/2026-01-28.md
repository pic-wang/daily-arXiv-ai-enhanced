### [1] [NavFormer: IGRF Forecasting in Moving Coordinate Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18800)
*Yoontae Hwang,Dongwoo Lee,Minseok Choi,Yong Sup Ihn,Daham Kim,Deok-Young Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NavFormer uses rotation-invariant features and a Canonical SPD module to forecast IGRF total intensity robustly against sensor attitude changes. In five-flight experiments it achieves lower error than strong baselines in standard, few-shot, and zero-shot settings; code available at the provided URL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triad magnetometer readings change with sensor attitude even when the target IGRF total intensity remains invariant. Forecasting this invariant target reliably is crucial for autonomous navigation.

Method: The approach employs rotation-invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window-level second moments of magnetometer triads without sign discontinuities. It builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix for each window and then applies state-dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates.

Result: Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few-shot training, and zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: NavFormer improves robustness of IGRF forecasting against attitude-induced variations by using a canonical SPD-based spectral stabilization, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities. The module builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix per window and applies state dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates. Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few shot training, and zero shot transfer.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

### [5] [How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830)
*Alireza Jafari,Fatemeh Jafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNN+单层BiLSTM在多标签ECG分类上性能与复杂性之间取得最佳折中，深层递归结构带来边际收益，甚至可能降低泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在多标签ECG分类中，面对长程时序依赖和类别不平衡，是否需要以及何种复杂递归结构来提升性能。

Method: 对PTB-XL数据集（23类诊断）进行系统性比较：采用CNN作为形态特征基线，分别接入LSTM、GRU、BiLSTM及其堆叠变体的多种递归配置，评估对多标签ECG分类的影响。采用的评价指标包括汉明损失、宏观AUPRC、微观F1、子集精度等。

Result: 结果显示，CNN+单层BiLSTM在预测性能与模型复杂度之间实现最佳权衡，汉明损失0.0338，宏观AUPRC0.4715，微观F1 0.6979，子集精度0.5723；相比于更深的递归组合，单层BiLSTM表现更佳。堆叠递归在某些稀有类上提升召回，但总体可能降低精度并带来过拟合风险，深度递归收益递减。

Conclusion: 与ECG信号的内在时间结构相匹配的架构比单纯追求递归深度更关键，CNN形态驱动特征结合单层BiLSTM即可实现鲁棒且具临床部署潜力的性能。

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

### [6] [The Geometric Reasoner: Manifold-Informed Latent Foresight Search for Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18832)
*Ren Zhuang,Ben Wang,Shuifa Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TGR，一种训练无关的几何前瞻框架，在严格内存约束下通过分块前瞻和几何正则提升长链式推理的轨迹覆盖率，开销略高但可控，在Qwen3-8B上AUC提升至多13点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决测试阶段长链式推理在计算成本与覆盖质量之间的根本权衡，提供训练成本低且内存友好的高覆盖率方案。

Method: 提出训练-free的几何推理框架TGR，在每个分块边界进行潜在锚点的分子信息驱动前瞻估计，结合软几何正则以促使轨迹平滑并实现多样化探索。采用分块级KV缓存重置，使内存复杂度随分块长度线性。

Result: 在挑战性数学与代码基准上，TGR显著提升鲁棒轨迹覆盖率（AUC）最多提升13点，且额外开销约为1.1–1.3倍。

Conclusion: 无需训练即可在严格内存约束下提升长CoT覆盖率，提供一个高效、可扩展的推理框架。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Motivation: 解决 Transformer 的二次复杂度与注意力本质的置换等价性，以及 MLP 的谱偏置，使得长序列预测具备更低复杂度且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 采用基于 Hahn 多项式的可学习激活函数的 Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks，构建端到端的 Hahn-KAN 区块，包含通道独立、patching、跨/局部 patch 的 KAN 层、残差连接以及双全连接瓶颈层。

Result: 在多项基准上稳定优于最新 SOTA；通过消融验证核心组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 提供一种轻量、可解释且有效的长周期多变量时间序列预测框架，善于同时捕捉全局与局部时间模式。

Abstract: Recent Transformer- and MLP-based models have demonstrated strong performance in long-term time series forecasting, yet Transformers remain limited by their quadratic complexity and permutation-equivariant attention, while MLPs exhibit spectral bias. We propose HaKAN, a versatile model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging Hahn polynomial-based learnable activation functions and providing a lightweight and interpretable alternative for multivariate time series forecasting. Our model integrates channel independence, patching, a stack of Hahn-KAN blocks with residual connections, and a bottleneck structure comprised of two fully connected layers. The Hahn-KAN block consists of inter- and intra-patch KAN layers to effectively capture both global and local temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its core components.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

*Xin Qiao,Shijie Sun,Anqi Dong,Cong Hua,Xia Zhao,Longfei Zhang,Guangming Zhu,Liang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在极端稀疏条件下，提出两阶段的 FSD-CAP 框架来提升图缺失特征的插补质量，通过局部结构驱动的扩散与分类感知传播实现鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺失特征在图任务中广泛存在，现有基于潜在表示或全局扩散的方法在高缺失率下易传播误差，难以提供可靠的估计，因此需要局部结构驱动的扩散与类信息约束以提升稳健性。

Method: FSD-CAP 包含两阶段：阶段1，基于图距离的子图扩展局部化扩散过程，使用分数扩散算子调整传播锐度以匹配局部结构；阶段2，使用类感知传播对已插补特征进行 refined，结合伪标签和邻域熵来促进一致性。 

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，在 99.5% 特征缺失的极端条件下，节点分类平均准确率为 80.06%（结构性缺失）和 81.01%（均匀分布缺失），接近全特征 GCN 的 81.31%。在同等设置下的链路预测 AUC 分别为 91.65%（结构性）和 92.41%（均匀），低于完全观测的 95.06%。此外，在大规模与异质性数据集上，该方法对比其他模型表现优越。 

Conclusion: FSD-CAP 能在极高缺失情况下显著提升插补质量并维持良好下游任务性能，且在大规模与异质性数据集上具备鲁棒性与优越性。

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

*Mehrdad Mohammadi,Qi Zheng,Ruoqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出离线多维分布式强化学习框架 KE-DRL，通过核均值嵌入将多维价值分布嵌入到 RKHS，并用目标策略估计分布，以替代 Wasserstein 距离，提高多维状态-行动和奖励空间的计算效率；给出分布式 Bellman 算符在 Matern 核下的收缩性及一致性，实验显示对离线评估鲁棒且可有效恢复核均值嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维连续状态-行动空间中，直接计算 Wasserstein 距离成本高且难以扩展；需要一种高效、健壮的分布估计与风险评估方法来支持离线强化学习。

Method: 将概率测度映射到再现核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）的核均值嵌入，通过积分概率度量替代 Wasserstein 距离；采用 Matern 核等构建核函数，建立离线多维框架，给出分布式 Bellman 算符在该度量下的收缩性并证明统一收敛性。

Result: 理论层面证明了在 Matern 核下的收缩性和统一收敛性；实验层面呈现对离线评估的鲁棒性以及在 Lipschitz/有界核假设下对核均值嵌入的有效恢复。

Conclusion: 嵌入式方法在复杂决策与风险评估场景具潜力，尤其适用于高维连续问题，提供高效且稳健的分布估计手段。

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

Abstract: We study a bi-level online provisioning and scheduling problem motivated by network resource allocation, where provisioning decisions are made at a slow time scale while queue-/state-dependent scheduling is performed at a fast time scale. We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions. Our new algorithm solves this learning problem via several non-trivial developments, including a carefully designed dual feedback that returns the budget multiplier as sensitivity information for the upper-level update and a lower level that solves a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem via an extended occupancy-measure linear program. We establish near-optimal regret and high-probability satisfaction of the cross-level constraints.

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/alexouadi/LightSBB-M.

Conclusion: 稀疏、神经元级别的更新提供了可扩展且更精确的对齐替代方案，减少数据需求同时保持或提升性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Motivation: 在高风险领域（如金融、医疗）部署AI必须兼具公平性与透明性；尽管法规要求偏见缓解，但对公平的定义常缺乏明确性。本文主张真正的公平应关注保护群体交叉维度的偏见，并需要可解释的模型以满足监管需求。

Conclusion: 本工作提供一个鲁棒的、可解释且可控的解决方案，用于在涉及交叉保护群体时的偏见缓解，并为监管合规及实际应用提供统一框架。

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

Motivation: 解决传统基于梯度搜索的样本效率低、难以同时优化多参数且易被漂移和样本条件变化影响的问题；同时避免纯深度学习方法在不同样品条件下需要大量再训练。

Method: 采用多目标贝叶斯优化框架，使用高斯过程对像差地形进行概率建模；主动选择最具信息量的透镜设置进行评估；允许用户定义与物理成像相关的奖励函数（如对称性），通过帕累托前沿呈现多目标权衡。

Result: 实验/仿真表明，该主动学习循环比传统优化（如Nelder–Mead）更鲁棒，能更有效地同时调谐焦点、像散和高阶像差，提升数据效率与自适应能力。

Conclusion: 通过平衡多重目标，该框架实现了在实验中对显微镜的自我优化与持续最佳性能的动态维持。

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Method: 推导元学习的下界缩放律，证明适应增益随梯度步数指数饱和且与任务方差线性相关；在量子门校准和经典线性二次控制上进行实验验证，验证缩放律的普适性。 

Result: 在低方差任务中自适应收益可忽略不计；在极端OOD条件（训练噪声的10倍）下，两量子比特门的保真度提升 >40%；同时对云量子处理器的逐设备标定时间具有潜在降低作用；经典LQR验证表明该规律源自一般优化几何而非量子特性。

Conclusion: 给出一个可迁移的自适应控制决策框架，帮助在不同场景下判断是否采用元学习自适应及其资源投入。

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在内存受限的情况下，KV 缓存对 eviction 策略高度敏感，传统的 LRU 在动态在线请求和跨工作节点的负载均衡中存在矛盾，难以同时最大化本地命中率和全局吞吐。

Method: 建立一个统一的数学模型以捕捉 KV 缓存 eviction 与查询路由之间的核心权衡，提出可证明有界竞争性的随机化 eviction 策略，并结合学习驱动的路由方法以适应不断演化的请求模式，达到负载平衡与命中率的折中。

Result: 在4个基准和3种前缀共享设置下进行大量实验，理论结果得到实验验证，缓存命中率最高提升6.92倍，延迟降低11.96倍，TTFT降低14.06倍，吞吐量提升77.4%；代码可在GitHub获取。

Conclusion: 该方法提供一个在内存受限、动态负载场景下的可回报优化框架，结合随机化 eviction 与学习驱动路由，优于现有方法，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

Motivation: 在多变量时序数据中，罕见事件预测面临严重的类别不平衡、长程依赖和分布不确定性，需要可校准的概率输出、尾部风险估计以及可解释性。

Method: 核心在于四个组件的协同：1) 可学习的注意力瓶颈实现时间动态的软聚合；2) 证据性头通过正态-逆伽玛分布估计观测不确定性（包括出现的偶然性和模型不确定性）；3) 极值头用广义帕雷托分布建模尾部风险；4) 早期事件前驱头。共同优化的复合损失包括焦点损失、证据性负对数似然以及尾部敏感的 EVT 惩罚，训练时生效，推理阶段仅用单一分类头，参数量约 0.81M。

Result: 在十年空间天气数据上，EVEREST 在24/48/72小时预测的TSS分别为0.973/0.970/0.966，达到或接近SOTA。模型紧凑、易于在普通硬件上训练，适用于高风险领域如工业监测、天气与卫星诊断。

Conclusion: 局限性包括对固定长度输入的依赖以及未考虑图像模态，未来工作可扩展到流式和多模态的预测。

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

Abstract: We rigorously study the thermodynamic limit of deep neural networks (DNNS) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), assuming that the activation functions are sigmoids. A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions. We compute the probability distribution of the output given the input, in the infinite-width case. We show that it admits a power-type expansion, where the constant term is a Gaussian distribution.

TL;DR: First-to-halt inference with winner-take-all training on Tiny Recursive Models achieves high puzzle accuracy with far less compute than test-time augmentation, matching TTA with a single forward pass on Sudoku-Extreme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological fast, energy-constrained systems rely on early signals as decisions. This work investigates whether first-to-halt decisions can be used in ML ensembles to reduce compute and latency while preserving accuracy.

Method: Ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). Predictions derived from the first model to halt. During training, maintain K parallel latent states but backprop through the lowest-loss 'winner' only. Introduce Muon (a modified SwiGLU) to enable training on constrained hardware. Train on Sudoku-Extreme with an RTX 5090. Compare single-pass, winner-take-all with test-time augmentation baselines.

Result: Achieves 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme with 10x less compute than TTA. A single model with winner-take-all achieves 96.9% ± 0.6% without TTA. Training with K=4 yields this performance in a single forward pass. Higher accuracy requires more steps: 1.5 hours for K=1 (7k steps to exceed baseline TRM), 6 hours for K=4 (36k steps).

Conclusion: First-to-halt ensembles and winner-take-all training enable fast, energy-efficient inference with competitive accuracy. Training-time strategies can substitute for test-time augmentations on constrained hardware, with Muon enabling viable training under resource limits.

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

TL;DR: FloydNet 通过维护全局的 all-pairs 关系张量并学习通用的 DP 操作符，替代局部消息传递来进行高阶图推理，理论上具备 3-WL（2-FWL）表达能力，并在 CLRS-30、TSP、BREC 等基准上取得显著优异的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 GNN 的消息传递具有局部瓶颈，难以实现全局、分步的关系推理。需要一个全局性、迭代式更新的学习框架以捕捉长程依赖。

Method: FloydNet 维持一个全局的点对关系张量，并学习一个广义的 DP 操作符来逐步 refine 该张量；通过这种 DP 风格的全局关系计算，形成任务特定的关系演算。该方法与 k-FWL、3-WL 表达能力相关联。

Result: 理论上证明 FloydNet 达到 3-WL (2-FWL) 的表达能力，其广义形式与 k-FWL 层级对齐；在实践中在 CLRS-30 算法基准上达到接近完美的分数 (>99%)，对一般 TSP 能找到精确最优解且显著超越强基线启发式方法，在 BREC 基准上实验上也与 3-WL 测试相当。

Conclusion: 将学习型 DP 风格的全局关系 refinement 作为一种强大且实用的替代局部消息传递的高层次图推理范式，具有较强的理论与实践潜力。

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning systems engineering requires a deep understanding of framework internals. Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale. The curriculum is available as open source at mlsysbook.ai slash tinytorch.

Motivation: 现有工具在 Apple Silicon 上要么缺失原生优化，要么仅支持文本模型，难以高效处理 multimodal workloads。统一内存架构需要更高效的缓存与批处理策略。

Method: 基于 MLX 原生实现，针对文本模型提供连续 batching 与优化，针对多模态引入基于内容哈希的缓存以避免重复视觉编码。

Result: 文本吞吐提升 21%-87% 相对 llama.cpp，达到 525 tokens/s；并发 16 时达到 4.3x 的聚合吞吐；多模态方面对重复图片查询实现 28x 提速，视频分析 64 帧下缓存速度提升 24.7x；总体吞吐和延迟显著改善。

Conclusion: 开源实现面向消费级 Apple 硬件，提升 LLM/MLLM 推理的效率和可扩展性，特别是在 multimodal 与重复输入场景。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA-like properties (ordered components, variance capture) are lost in nonlinear autoencoders. The work seeks to generalize PCA to nonlinear mappings by enforcing non-uniform variance regularization together with an isometric constraint.

Method: Introduce a non-uniform variance regularization term and an isometric constraint into the autoencoder objective, forming a framework that generalizes PCA to nonlinear settings while preserving ordered representations and variance retention.

Result: Conceptual framework claiming PCA-like advantages (ordered representations and variance retention) can be preserved in nonlinear DR via the proposed regularization and isometry constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework generalizes PCA to nonlinear dimensionality reduction, maintaining key PCA benefits while remaining effective for nonlinear mappings.

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied to inverse scattering problems (ISPs) due to their strong nonlinear mapping capabilities. However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

Conclusion: 提出的上下文排队带学习框架及耦合分析提供了对队列长度遗憾的新理解与界限，算法在不同上下文设定下均表现出理论与实验上的有效性，且方法具有潜在的推广性。

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更丰富的基准以评估学习多样的邻域聚合、将强大的表格基线作为标准，以及推动将表格模型应用于图数据以获得对相关任务的新见解。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

Abstract: Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning. Code and models are available at https://hotbento.github.io/LLM-VA-Web/.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP. Code is available at this repo: github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/GenCP.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning often faces environment drift, but most existing methods rely on static entropy coefficients/target entropy, causing over-exploration during stable periods and under-exploration after drift (thus slow recovery), and leaving unanswered the principled question of how exploration intensity should scale with drift magnitude. We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial tool in time series forecasting, especially for deep learning architectures that require a large training sample size to generalize effectively. However, extensive datasets are not always available in real-world scenarios. Although many data augmentation methods exist, their limitations include the use of transformations that do not adequately preserve data properties. This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix. We performed an extensive evaluation of Grasynda as a data augmentation method for time series forecasting. We use three neural network variations on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including ones used in state-of-the-art time series foundation models. The method and all experiments are publicly available.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.
  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter. Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

We provide theoretical guarantees establishing sublinear dynamic regret and sublinear constraint violation for our proposed policy. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both regret and constraint violation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: Explainable boosting machines (EBMs) are popular "glass-box" models that learn a set of univariate functions using boosting trees. These achieve explainability through visualizations of each feature's effect. However, unlike linear model coefficients, uncertainty quantification for the learned univariate functions requires computationally intensive bootstrapping, making it hard to know which features truly matter. We provide an alternative using recent advances in statistical inference for gradient boosting, deriving methods for statistical inference as well as end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Using a moving average instead of a sum of trees (Boulevard regularization) allows the boosting process to converge to a feature-wise kernel ridge regression. This produces asymptotically normal predictions that achieve the minimax-optimal mean squared error for fitting Lipschitz GAMs with $p$ features at rate $O(pn^{-2/3})$, successfully avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We then construct prediction intervals for the response and confidence intervals for each learned univariate function with a runtime independent of the number of datapoints, enabling further explainability within EBMs.

Motivation: Q-learning/SARSA对步长敏感，步长过大导致不稳定，步长过小导致收敛慢，需要自动化、无偏手动调参的步长调节方法。

Method: 将迭代更新重参数化为隐式固定点方程，得到步长随特征范数的逆比自适应调整；提供非渐近分析，证明在更宽的步长范围内仍稳定，甚至在有利条件下可采用大步长；在离散和连续状态空间的基准环境中进行经验验证。

Result: 隐式方法在更宽的步长范围内保持稳定；在有利条件下可使用任意大步长且收敛速度相当；实验证明对步长选择的敏感性显著降低，能用原本会失败的步长实现稳定性能。

Conclusion: 隐式Q-learning和SARSA提供自动正则化，显著降低对步长选择的敏感性，并在离散与连续状态空间中表现出稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Q-learning and SARSA are foundational reinforcement learning algorithms whose practical success depends critically on step-size calibration. Step-sizes that are too large can cause numerical instability, while step-sizes that are too small can lead to slow progress. We propose implicit variants of Q-learning and SARSA that reformulate their iterative updates as fixed-point equations. This yields an adaptive step-size adjustment that scales inversely with feature norms, providing automatic regularization without manual tuning. Our non-asymptotic analyses demonstrate that implicit methods maintain stability over significantly broader step-size ranges. Under favorable conditions, it permits arbitrarily large step-sizes while achieving comparable convergence rates. Empirical validation across benchmark environments spanning discrete and continuous state spaces shows that implicit Q-learning and SARSA exhibit substantially reduced sensitivity to step-size selection, achieving stable performance with step-sizes that would cause standard methods to fail.

Abstract: Distributed high dimensional mean estimation is a common aggregation routine used often in distributed optimization methods. Most of these applications call for a communication-constrained setting where vectors, whose mean is to be estimated, have to be compressed before sharing. One could independently encode and decode these to achieve compression, but that overlooks the fact that these vectors are often close to each other. To exploit these similarities, recently Suresh et al., 2022, Jhunjhunwala et al., 2021, Jiang et al, 2023, proposed multiple correlation-aware compression schemes. However, in most cases, the correlations have to be known for these schemes to work. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of graceful degradation of these correlation-aware compression schemes with increasing dissimilarity is limited to only the $\ell_2$-error in the literature. In this paper, we propose four different collaborative compression schemes that agnostically exploit the similarities among vectors in a distributed setting. Our schemes are all simple to implement and computationally efficient, while resulting in big savings in communication. The analysis of our proposed schemes show how the $\ell_2$, $\ell_\infty$ and cosine estimation error varies with the degree of similarity among vectors.

### [96] [Convergence of Muon with Newton-Schulz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19156)
*Gyu Yeol Kim,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Muon通过Newton-Schulz近似实现的动量正交化，其收敛性与SVD极化的理想化近似相同的速率（对给定步数q的常数因子），且该常数以q双指数收敛至1；并且比向量化优化器SGD带动的平方根秩损失要小。理论解释了为何少量低阶Newton-Schulz步即可实现接近精确极化的行为，以及矩阵正交化的粒度对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Muon在实践中用Newton-Schulz步实现动量正交化时，理论结果与基于SVD极化的理想化之间的关系，量化收敛速率、常数因子及其随q和多项式度数的变化，以缩小理论与实践之间的差距。

Method: 对使用Newton-Schulz近似的Muon进行理论分析，与Exact SVD极化结果对比；推导以给定q步的收敛速率的常数因子，并证明该常数以q的双指数方式收敛到1；研究多项式度数对该常数的影响，并比较Muon相对于向量基优化器（SGD with momentum）的秩损失。

Result: 得到的结果包括：Muon在使用q步Newton-Schulz时的收敛速率与SVD极化理想化在同等水平，且仅存在与常数相关的差异；该常数对q的双指数收敛至1，并且更高的多项式度数进一步提升收敛性质；Muon消除了相对于SGD带来的平方根秩损失，解释了为何在更快的墙钟时间内接近精确极化行为。

Conclusion: 理论证明支持Muon采用Newton-Schulz步进行矩阵正交化的设计，缩小实践与理论之间的差距，说明少量低阶Newton-Schulz步即可达到接近SVD极化的效果，并阐明了该设计在效率与收敛性方面的优势。

Abstract: We analyze Muon as originally proposed and used in practice -- using the momentum orthogonalization with a few Newton-Schulz steps. The prior theoretical results replace this key step in Muon with an exact SVD-based polar factor. We prove that Muon with Newton-Schulz converges to a stationary point at the same rate as the SVD-polar idealization, up to a constant factor for a given number $q$ of Newton-Schulz steps. We further analyze this constant factor and prove that it converges to 1 doubly exponentially in $q$ and improves with the degree of the polynomial used in Newton-Schulz for approximating the orthogonalization direction. We also prove that Muon removes the typical square-root-of-rank loss compared to its vector-based counterpart, SGD with momentum. Our results explain why Muon with a few low-degree Newton-Schulz steps matches exact-polar (SVD) behavior at a much faster wall-clock time and explain how much momentum matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz benefits over the vector-based optimizer. Overall, our theory justifies the practical Newton-Schulz design of Muon, narrowing its practice-theory gap.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出双重公平学习（DFL）框架用于策略学习中的行动公平、结果公平与价值最大化之间的权衡。通过多目标优化结合分层的Tchebyshev方法，获得超越凸设的Pareto解，并具备理论无悔（regret）界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政策学习是干预性任务，存在行动公平与结果公平这两类目标；简单等化行动并不等化结果，且不同群体对同一行动的约束或反应不同，因此需要同时管理两类公平与价值最大化之间的权衡。

Method: 将公平性嵌入多目标优化问题，提出双重公平学习（DFL）框架；采用带权的分层（lexicographic）Tchebyshev方法来近似Pareto前沿，能够在非凸设置下恢复Pareto解，并给出理论上的 regret 边界；框架可兼容多种常见的公平定义。

Result: 在全面仿真中，DFL相较于竞争方法取得改进；在 motor third-party liability 保险数据集和创业培训数据集上的应用中，显著提升行动公平与结果公平，同时对整体价值的损失仅为适度。

Conclusion: DFL提供一个灵活且具理论保证的策略学习公平框架，能够在非凸情形下获得Pareto解，并在实际数据中提升公平性，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Fairness is a central pillar of trustworthy machine learning, especially in domains where accuracy- or profit-driven optimization is insufficient. While most fairness research focuses on supervised learning, fairness in policy learning remains less explored. Because policy learning is interventional, it induces two distinct fairness targets: action fairness (equitable action assignments) and outcome fairness (equitable downstream consequences). Crucially, equalizing actions does not generally equalize outcomes when groups face different constraints or respond differently to the same action. We propose a novel double fairness learning (DFL) framework that explicitly manages the trade-off among three objectives: action fairness, outcome fairness, and value maximization. We integrate fairness directly into a multi-objective optimization problem for policy learning and employ a lexicographic weighted Tchebyshev method that recovers Pareto solutions beyond convex settings, with theoretical guarantees on the regret bounds. Our framework is flexible and accommodates various commonly used fairness notions. Extensive simulations demonstrate improved performance relative to competing methods. In applications to a motor third-party liability insurance dataset and an entrepreneurship training dataset, DFL substantially improves both action and outcome fairness while incurring only a modest reduction in overall value.

Abstract: We propose a framework to construct practical kernel-based two-sample tests from the family of $f$-divergences. The test statistic is computed from the witness function of a regularized variational representation of the divergence, which we estimate using kernel methods. The proposed test is adaptive over hyperparameters such as the kernel bandwidth and the regularization parameter. We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of $f$-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of $f$-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different $f$-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations.

Abstract: Processing high-volume, streaming data is increasingly common in modern statistics and machine learning, where batch-mode algorithms are often impractical because they require repeated passes over the full dataset. This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling. Beyond synthetic experiments, we also validate practical effectiveness on two real-world datasets, including a bioinformatics study of dent maize genotypes under drought stress that integrates high-dimensional proteomics with ecophysiological traits, where incremental stochastic MM yields stable gains in predictive performance.
