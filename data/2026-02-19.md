### [1] [Including Node Textual Metadata in Laplacian-constrained Gaussian Graphical Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15920)
*Jianhua Wang,Killian Cressant,Pedro Braconnot Velloso,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A Laplacian-constrained GGM framework that fuses node signals with auxiliary metadata for graph learning, optimized via a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates; shows improved graph clustering on a financial dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GGM-based graph estimation often ignores rich metadata associated with nodes. Incorporating auxiliary descriptions can provide complementary information to improve graph structure learning and clustering.

Method: Formulates a joint optimization problem imposing Laplacian constraints on the precision matrix of a GGM while integrating both node signal data and metadata. Develops an efficient MM algorithm with closed-form updates per iteration.

Result: Experiments on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate significant improvements in graph clustering performance when using the fused signals+metadata approach compared with methods that use only signals or only metadata.

Conclusion: Fusing node signals with metadata in Laplacian-constrained GGMs yields better graph learning and clustering performance, highlighting the benefit of integrating heterogeneous information sources.

Abstract: This paper addresses graph learning in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs). In this context, data matrices often come with auxiliary metadata (e.g., textual descriptions associated with each node) that is usually ignored in traditional graph estimation processes. To fill this gap, we propose a graph learning approach based on Laplacian-constrained GGMs that jointly leverages the node signals and such metadata. The resulting formulation yields an optimization problem, for which we develop an efficient majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates at each iteration. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves graph clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use either signals or metadata alone, thus illustrating the interest of fusing both sources of information.

Abstract: Stochastic-gradient MCMC methods enable scalable Bayesian posterior sampling but often suffer from sensitivity to minibatch size and gradient noise. To address this, we propose Stochastic Gradient Lattice Random Walk (SGLRW), an extension of the Lattice Random Walk discretization. Unlike conventional Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), SGLRW introduces stochastic noise only through the off-diagonal elements of the update covariance; this yields greater robustness to minibatch size while retaining asymptotic correctness. Furthermore, as comparison we analyze a natural analogue of SGLD utilizing gradient clipping. Experimental validation on Bayesian regression and classification demonstrates that SGLRW remains stable in regimes where SGLD fails, including in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise, and matches or improves predictive performance.

### [3] [Partial Identification under Missing Data Using Weak Shadow Variables from Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16061)
*Hongyu Chen,David Simchi-Levi,Ruoxuan Xiong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一个部分识别框架，通过对观测数据和来自LLMs的弱影子变量的线性约束进行线性规划，给出MNAR背景下的可识别集合的尖界；若预测信息充分，界线收敛到点估计；在有限样本中使用集合扩展估计量，覆盖性可控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在反馈存在MNAR且缺乏传统影子变量完备性条件时，需要不强参数假设的识别方法；引入弱影子变量使利用LLM预测成为可能，并与线性规划结合获得更紧的界限。

Method: 把问题转化为两段线性规划约束：观测数据结构约束和来自弱影子变量的线性约束；引入LLMs作为额外约束；若预测信息充分，界限收敛到点；有限样本中采用集合扩展估计，收敛率在未点识别时慢于√n，在点识别时为√n。

Result: 仿真与半合成实验表明，LLM预测往往对传统影子变量方法不友好，但在本框架下有效，能把识别区间缩短75–83%，且覆盖率保持在真实MNAR机制下的有效水平。

Conclusion: 将弱影子变量整合进部分识别框架，为MNAR场景提供更灵活的估计工具，特别是当有强预测模型可用但不满足完备性条件时。

Abstract: Estimating population quantities such as mean outcomes from user feedback is fundamental to platform evaluation and social science, yet feedback is often missing not at random (MNAR): users with stronger opinions are more likely to respond, so standard estimators are biased and the estimand is not identified without additional assumptions. Existing approaches typically rely on strong parametric assumptions or bespoke auxiliary variables that may be unavailable in practice. In this paper, we develop a partial identification framework in which sharp bounds on the estimand are obtained by solving a pair of linear programs whose constraints encode the observed data structure. This formulation naturally incorporates outcome predictions from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs), as additional linear constraints that tighten the feasible set. We call these predictions weak shadow variables: they satisfy a conditional independence assumption with respect to missingness but need not meet the completeness conditions required by classical shadow-variable methods. When predictions are sufficiently informative, the bounds collapse to a point, recovering standard identification as a special case. In finite samples, to provide valid coverage of the identified set, we propose a set-expansion estimator that achieves slower-than-$\sqrt{n}$ convergence rate in the set-identified regime and the standard $\sqrt{n}$ rate under point identification. In simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on customer-service dialogues, we find that LLM predictions are often ill-conditioned for classical shadow-variable methods yet remain highly effective in our framework. They shrink identification intervals by 75--83\% while maintaining valid coverage under realistic MNAR mechanisms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents to solve complex tasks such as question answering (QA), scientific debate, and software development. A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This note gives a self-contained overview of some important properties of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, compared with the standard linear optimal transport (OT) framework. More specifically, I explore the following questions: are GW optimal transport plans sparse? Under what conditions are they supported on a permutation? Do they satisfy a form of cyclical monotonicity? In particular, I present the conditionally negative semi-definite property and show that, when it holds, there are GW optimal plans that are sparse and supported on a permutation.

TL;DR: 从部分排序信息中学习个体偏好：将对比视为可观测性受限的二项逻辑选择，并结合可解释属性、固定效应与低秩因子；通过逆概率加权的岭回归与基于 IPW 的 SGD 实现大规模估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在经济和市场营销中，偏好需要从部分可观测的对比中推断，同时需纠正由进入考虑集的观测偏差（曝光偏差）导致的偏倚，并实现跨用户/商品的信息共享与可解释性。

Method: 将潜在效用表示为属性之和、商品固定效应和用户-商品的低秩因子；对比的观测性由每个商品的可观测性概率构成，通过逻辑回归建模；采用逆概率加权（IPW）加岭回归极大似然来估计偏好参数；为扩展规模，提出基于 IPW 重采样的随机梯度下降（SGD）算法。

Conclusion: 该框架同时兼顾可解释性与信息共享，具备良好的可扩展性，并能有效纠正观测偏差，适用于偏好学习与个性化推荐等场景。

Abstract: Estimating consumer preferences is central to many problems in economics and marketing. This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products.

### [9] [Functional Decomposition and Shapley Interactions for Interpreting Survival Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16505)
*Sophie Hanna Langbein,Hubert Baniecki,Fabian Fumagalli,Niklas Koenen,Marvin N. Wright,Julia Herbinger*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ提供了一种面向生存模型的交互式、时序化解释框架。通过将高阶效应分解为随时间的和非时间的分量，结合将Shapley交互扩展到时间索引函数的估计方法，实现对生存模型的可解释性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存预测中的风险和生存函数具有本质上的非加性，导致传统的线性/逐步解释方法不再适用，需要理解特征之间的高阶交互以及随时间的依赖性，以获得更可靠的解释。

Method: 提出SurvFD，对高阶效应进行时间相关与时间无关的分解；在此基础上引入SurvSHAP-IQ，将Shapley交互扩展至时间索引的函数，提供对高阶、随时间变化的交互的实用估计器。

Result: 提供了一种新的生存解释视角，能够明确描述在何种情形下加性解释失效，并给出估计高阶时间相关交互的实际工具，具有在广泛的生存分析任务中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 构建了一个面向交互与时间的生存建模解释框架，为生存预测任务提供更丰富的解释能力与应用场景。

Abstract: Hazard and survival functions are natural, interpretable targets in time-to-event prediction, but their inherent non-additivity fundamentally limits standard additive explanation methods. We introduce Survival Functional Decomposition (SurvFD), a principled approach for analyzing feature interactions in machine learning survival models. By decomposing higher-order effects into time-dependent and time-independent components, SurvFD offers a previously unrecognized perspective on survival explanations, explicitly characterizing when and why additive explanations fail. Building on this theoretical decomposition, we propose SurvSHAP-IQ, which extends Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions, providing a practical estimator for higher-order, time-dependent interactions. Together, SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ establish an interaction- and time-aware interpretability approach for survival modeling, with broad applicability across time-to-event prediction tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly trained or fine-tuned on synthetic data. Recursively training on such data has been observed to significantly degrade performance in a wide range of tasks, often characterized by a progressive drift away from the target distribution. In this work, we theoretically analyze this phenomenon in the setting of score-based diffusion models. For a realistic pipeline where each training round uses a combination of synthetic data and fresh samples from the target distribution, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the accumulated divergence between the generated and target distributions. This allows us to characterize different regimes of drift, depending on the score estimation error and the proportion of fresh data used in each generation. We also provide empirical results on synthetic data and images to illustrate the theory.

Abstract: The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.

### [12] [A Koopman-Bayesian Framework for High-Fidelity, Perceptually Optimized Haptic Surgical Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15834)
*Rohit Kaushik,Eva Kaushik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified Koopman-based haptic rendering framework with Bayesian perceptual calibration for surgical simulation, achieving ultra-low latency and improved perceptual fidelity, outperforming conventional rendering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance realism and training effectiveness in surgical simulation by integrating nonlinear tissue dynamics, perceptual-inspired force rendering, and high-frequency haptic feedback.

Method: Augment tissue–device dynamics with Koopman operator to enable linear prediction/control of nonlinear dynamics; Bayesian calibration using Weber–Fechner and Stevens laws to tailor force signals to individual perceptual thresholds; evaluate on palpation, incision, and bone milling tasks with metrics on latency, force error, and perceptual discrimination.

Result: Rendering latency 4.3 ms; force error <2.8%; ~20% improvement in perceptual discrimination; MANOVA and regression show significant performance gains over conventional spring-ddamper and energy-based rendering methods.

Conclusion: Potential to advance surgical training and VR-based medical education; future work toward closed-loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.

*Ryosuke Kohita,Seiichiro Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 MaMe-Re 基准，用于 meme 回复选择任务；大语言模型在捕捉语言中的夸张等社交线索方面有初步证据，但视觉信息未能提升性能；模型在可控条件下接近人类判断，但难以区分语义相近候选中的微妙幽默差异，表明在上下文幽默选择上仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究主要动机是理解在对话中如何以幽默方式使用 meme 的上下文依存性，弥补以往更多关注 meme 的静态属性的研究空白；需要一个大规模、带注释的跨模态基准来评估在真实场景中的幽默理解和回复选择。

Method: 构建 MaMe-Re 基准：100,000 对开放授权的日本漫画面板与社媒帖子配对，累计 500,000 个人标注来自 2,325 位标注者；对多模态（文本+视觉）信息进行评估，使用大语言模型进行对比分析，探讨是否使用视觉信息；分析人机对比与对比控制设置。

Result: 得到三点关键发现：1) 大语言模型在捕捉夸张等复杂社交流用信号方面有初步能力；2) 引入视觉信息并未提升模型性能，显示理解视觉内容与将其应用于上下文幽默之间存在缺口；3) LLMs在受控设置下可达到接近人类判断的水平，但难以区分语义相近候选之间的细微幽默差异。

Conclusion: 在当前模型下，基于上下文的幽默回复选择仍是一个开放性挑战；需要进一步改进多模态理解、情境推理和对微妙幽默差异的分辨能力。

Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.

*Barak Or*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于创新信号的运行时稳定性框架，用于混合工具增强推理系统，通过监控创新统计、检测不稳定并触发恢复控制，实验显示可在任务失败前检测并通过恢复重新实现有界内部行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在部分可观测性和持续证据错配场景下的运行时稳定性问题。实际失败多源于内部推理动态的渐进性发散，而非单次预测错误，因此需要将稳定性作为系统层面的目标来避免崩溃。

Method: 将推理建模为以内部创新信号驱动的随机推断过程，提出 cognitive drift 的概念；以可检测性、边界发散和可恢复性定义稳定性，并构建一个运行时稳定性框架，监控创新统计、检测不稳定并触发恢复感知控制（recovery-aware control）机制。

Result: 在多步、工具增强的推理任务中，能够在任务失败前可靠地检测到不稳定性；在可行时，恢复可将内部行为重新收敛到有界状态，且在有限时间内实现。

Conclusion: 强调运行时稳定性是实现不确定性下可靠推理的系统级前提，所提出的框架有助于在运行时发现并纠正不稳定性，提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.

TL;DR: 用多目标遗传算法 NSGA-II 自动优化Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) 的结构，以同时最小化预测误差 RMSE 与复杂度惩罚，从而得到更简单、平滑且置信区间更窄的可解释模型；在加州房价数据集上优于基线 LinearGAM，且复杂度显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 GAM 结构的手动配置困难，兼顾预测准确性与可解释性。通过将稀疏性、平滑性和不确定性整合到一个复杂度惩罚中，并以多目标优化来平衡这几个目标。

Method: 采用 NSGA-II 进行多目标优化，目标函数为 RMSE 和 Complexity Penalty（覆盖稀疏性、平滑性和不确定性）。在 California Housing 数据集上评估，与基线 LinearGAM 比较，发现所得到的 GAM 具有更低的复杂度、对齐的平滑性以及更窄的置信区间。给出代码实现与复现路径（GitHub）。

Result: NSGA-II 能发现的 GAMs 在准确性上优于基线 LinearGAM，或在显著降低复杂度的同时保持相同水平的性能；所得模型更简单、更加平滑，置信区间更窄。

Conclusion: 提供了一般性的自动化优化框架，用于得到透明且高性能的模型；该方法可推广到其他需要可解释性和高效性的模型场景。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

TL;DR: 提出信息论的最优样本量估计（IT-OSE）用于工业数据增强，并给出区间覆盖与偏差的 ICD 分数以评估 OSS，理论分析 OSS 与影响因素并提高可解释性，在实验中显著提升分类/回归性能并对传感器工业场景具有泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业数据增强场景中，缺乏对最优样本量的理论估计和评估指标，难以保证数据增强的效果及其稳定性。需要一个理论-可解释的框架来估计 OSS 并评估偏差。

Method: 提出信息论驱动的最优样本量估计（IT-OSE），以信息量和不确定性为基础进行 OSS 估计；提出区间覆盖与偏差分数（ICD）用于直观评估估计的准确性与稳定性；理论分析 OSS 与主导因素的关系以提升解释性。

Result: 相比经验估计，IT-OSE 在分类任务中平均提升 4.38%；回归任务中平均降低 MAPE 18.80%；ICD 相关指标如 ICDdev 降低约 49.30%；在与穷举搜索对比时，在相同 OSS 下数据与计算成本分别降低约 83.97% 与 93.46%；方法在传感器驱动的工业场景中表现出良好的普遍性和泛化性。

Conclusion: IT-OSE 提供一个稳定、可解释且高效的 OSS 估计框架，适用于工业数据增强，能够提升下游模型性能并显著降低成本，同时具有良好的一般化能力。

Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.

Motivation: 传统的 P300 ERP 基于 BCI 拼写系统通常需要较长的参与者特征校准以构建二分类器，且标注数据有限时系统效率受限。

Method: 在有限标注数据条件下，提出自适应半监督 EM-GMM 框架以更新二分类器，并对训练数据进行标定；在测试阶段基于字符级准确率、信息传输率(ITR)和BCI效用进行评估。

Result: 在15名参与者中，9名达到字符级准确率≥0.7（不论是自适应方法还是基线方法）；其中7名在使用自适应方法时优于基线。

Conclusion: 该半监督框架为标注数据有限情境下的实时 BCI 拼写系统提供一种实用、高效的改进途径，提升拼写效率。

Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.

Conclusion: 充分利用高斯奖励的聚簇/层次和单峰假设可在MAB问题中实现更小的遗憾，TSCG与UTSCG提供了一种有效的结构化贝叶斯探索策略。

Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.

Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.

Motivation: 解决在线 Q-learning 在不使用乐观性/奖励项时的高概率 regret 分析，以及在小 suboptimality gap 时的退化问题；并引入对契约性马尔可夫过程下的随机逼近的新高概率收敛界，具有更广泛的适用性。

Method: 1) 对 Boltzmann Q-learning（温度衰减）进行分析，揭示其 regret 受 MDP 子最优性间隙影响：间隙大时为子线性，间隙小时趋于线性。2) 提出 Smoothed ε_n-Greedy（结合 ε_n-贪婪与 Boltzmann 探索）的探索方案，并证明其 gap-鲁棒的 near-tilde O(N^{9/10}) regret。3) 构建对含迭代和时间依赖的转移动力学的合约性 Markovian 随机逼近的高概率收敛界，收敛因子由混合时间决定且可渐近趋近1。

Result: 对 Boltzmann Q-learning，当间隙足够大时，regret 为子线性；间隙小时则可能接近线性增长。Smoothed ε_n-Greedy 实现了对 gap 的鲁棒性，获得 near-tilde O(N^{9/10}) 的高概率 regret 上界。所提出的高概率 concentration bound 可独立使用，其 contraction 速率受混合时间控制并可收敛到 1。

Conclusion: 首次在在线 Q-learning 的高概率 regret 方面给出结果且不依赖乐观性/奖励项，同时引入结合 ε_n-Greedy 与 Boltzmann 的平滑探索策略以实现 gap-鲁棒的 regret；并提供一个在带时间/迭代相关的马尔可夫性随机逼近中的高概率收敛界，有望推广到更广泛的非平稳或时变情形。

Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.

Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.

Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hubness in high-dimensional representations distorts nearest-neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics, degrading evaluation of generative models.

Method: Adapt the Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM) to real and generated data and introduce a multi-scale extension to robustly estimate neighborhoods.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks show GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, stabilizes metrics, and better correlates with human judgment.

Conclusion: GICDM provides a more reliable and human-aligned evaluation of generative models by mitigating hubness through corrected neighborhood estimation.

Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MI攻击多聚焦静态模型，忽略了训练过程中的模型更新动态。随着模型不断更新，攻击者可以获取更丰富的信号以提高攻击能力；因此需要在动态设置中推导“最优”MI攻击并评估其在有限样本条件下的表现，以改进隐私审计。

Method: 定义并推导 SeMI* 的最优功效，针对经验均值在有限样本下的最优性给出解析。利用模型更新序列来定位目标样本插入的时间点和 canary，比较有无隐私保护情况下的信号强度衰减。通过对跨数据分布及 DP-SGD 训练/微调的模型进行实验，验证理论结论并比较与现有基线的隐私审计效果。

Result: 得到 SeMI* 在经验均值下的最优功效，理论上证明了相比于仅关注最终模型的攻击，使用更新序列可避免信号稀释，且可对插入时间和可疑 canary 进行更精确调参以实现更紧的隐私审计。实证结果表明，在不同数据分布与 DP-SGD 情况下，SeMI* 的变体对隐私审计的提升超过基线方法。

Conclusion: 模型的动态更新提供了更丰富的信息通道，理论上的最优MI攻击可以利用这一路径实现更强的识别能力，并且在实践中能显著提升隐私审计的紧凑性与可靠性。该框架对跨数据分布和不同训练设置具有鲁棒性，特别是在对DP-SGD环境下的模型进行审计时尤为有效。

Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.

Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.

Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 通过离散随机定位（DSL）训练单一的去噪器，使其跨越不同腐蚀级别，显著提升 MDLM/ReMDM 的步长效率，在低步长下获得 MAUVE 增益，在高步长下接近自回归质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非自回归生成在并行预测大量 token 时降低解码延迟，但迭代细化容易产生错误累积和自生成草稿的分布偏移。现代 MDLMs 及其 remasking 采样（如 ReMDM）可视为一种迭代式的重写草稿过程。仅通过训练就能显著提高这类方法的步数效率。

Method: 提出离散随机定位（DSL，Discrete Stochastic Localization），在 Diffusion Transformer 中训练一个对信噪比不变（SNR-invariant）的去噪器，覆盖从中间草稿噪声到端点掩码式腐蚀的连续腐蚀级别。

Result: 在 OpenWebText 数据集上，DSL 微调在低步预算下实现显著的 MAUVE 增益，超过 MDLM+ReMDM 基线约 4 倍的去噪器评估次数，并在高预算下达到与自回归模型相当的质量。分析表明具备更强的自我纠错与不确定性校准，从而显著提升 remasking 的计算效率。

Conclusion: 仅通过训练即可显著提升 MDLM/ReMDM 采样的步数效率，DSL 通过统一的去噪器和跨腐蚀级别的训练实现更高效且鲁棒的 NAR 迭代细化。

Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.

Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

Abstract: LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.

Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.

Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.

Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.

The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.

Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.

Abstract: Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task. However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.

Abstract: Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place. The code is available at the link https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/SEMixer.

Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.

Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.

Conclusion: 该工作给出与期望界形式相近的高概率无后悔界，并界定在该框架下 δ 的最佳指数受限于额外假设。

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.

Motivation: 为解决强烈不平衡的耀斑预测问题、提升预测时间窗内的准确性与可解释性，同时比较不同数据源（LOS vs 向量磁场）及知识驱动特征与原始磁图的预测能力，且对比国家航天机构的基准（NASA/CCMC）。

Method: 构建包含知识驱动特征与LOS磁场数据的多数据集；应用三种深度学习模型（CNN、CNN-BiLSTM、Transformer）及其对应的CDR版本（CDR-CNN、CDR-CNN-BiLSTM、CDR-Transformer）；分析LOS参数对Transformer的影响并比较LOS-only、vector-only、混合数据的性能；进行奖励设计敏感性分析、使用SHAP进行模型解释，并与NASA/CCMC基准进行对比。

Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.

Conclusion: 提供了一条快速、可扩展的潜变量空间上下文压缩路径，显著提升大规模语言模型处理长上下文的实用性与部署可行性；框架具有良好的扩展性与对未来改进的潜力。

Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

Abstract: Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.

In this work, we explore the underlying biological and chemical model from a data driven perspective. Additionally, we present a machine learning based solution named \textit{Guide-Guard} to predict the behavior of the system given a gRNA in the CRISPR gene-editing process with 84\% accuracy. This solution is able to be trained on multiple different genes at the same time while retaining accuracy.

Abstract: This work presents HAWX, a hardware-aware scalable exploration framework that employs multi-level sensitivity scoring at different DNN abstraction levels (operator, filter, layer, and model) to guide selective integration of heterogeneous AxC blocks. Supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area, HAWX accelerates the evaluation of candidate configurations, achieving over 23* speedup in a layer-level search with two candidate approximate blocks and more than (3*106)* speedup at the filter-level search only for LeNet-5, while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive search. Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size. The HAWX hardware-aware search algorithm supports both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures, leveraging either off-the-shelf approximate components or customized designs.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of IG and SHAP to explain LSTM-based fault diagnosis on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP); SHAP can be more informative and closer to root cause, while IG is consistent with SHAP on many features; approach is model-agnostic and generalizable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability of fault-detection decisions in complex chemical processes by applying state-of-the-art XAI methods (IG and SHAP) to an LSTM classifier, and to identify the subsystem where faults originate.

Method: Train a high-accuracy LSTM classifier to detect faults on TEP data. Apply Integrated Gradients (IG) and SHAP to explain the classifier's decisions. Compare the highlighted features across methods, and map them to process subsystems using domain knowledge to assess fault localization. Discuss the model-agnostic nature and generalizability of the approach.

Result: In most cases, the same features are identified as important by both IG and SHAP. SHAP, in some cases, appears more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. The approach is model-agnostic and not limited to TEP, suggesting applicability to similar problems.

Conclusion: XAI methods can aid in localizing faults to subsystems in complex processes. SHAP may offer more informative, closer-to-root explanations in certain cases, while IG provides consistent feature importance across most instances. The methodology is generalizable to other processes and models.

Abstract: In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.

Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.

Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.

Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.

Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).

Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.

Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.

Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2026_Tokenizer.

Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.

Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.

Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.

Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.

Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
