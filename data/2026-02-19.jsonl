We answer affirmatively by showing that exposure to membership inference attack (MIA) is fundamentally governed by a data point's influence on the learned model. We formalize this in the linear setting by establishing a theoretical correspondence between individual MIA risk and the leverage score, identifying it as a principled metric for vulnerability. This characterization explains how data-dependent sensitivity translates into exposure, without the computational burden of training shadow models. Building on this, we propose a computationally efficient generalization of the leverage score for deep learning. Empirical evaluations confirm a strong correlation between the proposed score and MIA success, validating this metric as a practical surrogate for individual privacy risk assessment."}

In this context, data matrices often come with auxiliary metadata (e.g., textual descriptions associated with each node) that is usually ignored in traditional graph estimation processes.

The resulting formulation yields an optimization problem, for which we develop an efficient majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates at each iteration. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves graph clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use either signals or metadata alone, thus illustrating the interest of fusing both sources of information."}

Existing approaches typically rely on strong parametric assumptions or bespoke auxiliary variables that may be unavailable in practice. In this paper, we develop a partial identification framework in which sharp bounds on the estimand are obtained by solving a pair of linear programs whose constraints encode the observed data structure. This formulation naturally incorporates outcome predictions from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs), as additional linear constraints that tighten the feasible set. We call these predictions weak shadow variables: they satisfy a conditional independence assumption with respect to missingness but need not meet the completeness conditions required by classical shadow-variable methods. When predictions are sufficiently informative, the bounds collapse to a point, recovering standard identification as a special case. In finite samples, to provide valid coverage of the identified set, we propose a set-expansion estimator that achieves slower-than-$\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rate in the set-identified regime and the standard $\\sqrt{n}$ rate under point identification. In simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on customer-service dialogues, we find that LLM predictions are often ill-conditioned for classical shadow-variable methods yet remain highly effective in our framework.

To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods.

A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers.

In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics."}

Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks.

In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty."}

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios."}

This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products."}

To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage.

Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics.

As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity."}

Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead.

They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines."}

We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions."}

Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies."}

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation."}

This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring."}

In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets."}

Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model.

We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization."}

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations."}

In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures."}

Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction.

This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models.

We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC."}

We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically."}

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss."}

We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures.

While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."}

The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework.

We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines.

For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability."}

It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case."}

Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency."}

To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods.

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing."}

Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction.

Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines."}

A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible."}

In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.

For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations."}

Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers."}

While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding."}

First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points.

Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts.

We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

We answer affirmatively by showing that exposure to membership inference attack (MIA) is fundamentally governed by a data point's influence on the learned model. We formalize this in the linear setting by establishing a theoretical correspondence between individual MIA risk and the leverage score, identifying it as a principled metric for vulnerability. This characterization explains how data-dependent sensitivity translates into exposure, without the computational burden of training shadow models. Building on this, we propose a computationally efficient generalization of the leverage score for deep learning. Empirical evaluations confirm a strong correlation between the proposed score and MIA success, validating this metric as a practical surrogate for individual privacy risk assessment."}

In this context, data matrices often come with auxiliary metadata (e.g., textual descriptions associated with each node) that is usually ignored in traditional graph estimation processes. To fill this gap, we propose a graph learning approach based on Laplacian-constrained GGMs that jointly leverages the node signals and such metadata. The resulting formulation yields an optimization problem, for which we develop an efficient majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates at each iteration. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves graph clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use either signals or metadata alone, thus illustrating the interest of fusing both sources of information."}

To address this, we propose Stochastic Gradient Lattice Random Walk (SGLRW), an extension of the Lattice Random Walk discretization. Unlike conventional Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), SGLRW introduces stochastic noise only through the off-diagonal elements of the update covariance; this yields greater robustness to minibatch size while retaining asymptotic correctness. Furthermore, as comparison we analyze a natural analogue of SGLD utilizing gradient clipping. Experimental validation on Bayesian regression and classification demonstrates that SGLRW remains stable in regimes where SGLD fails, including in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise, and matches or improves predictive performance."}

Existing approaches typically rely on strong parametric assumptions or bespoke auxiliary variables that may be unavailable in practice. In this paper, we develop a partial identification framework in which sharp bounds on the estimand are obtained by solving a pair of linear programs whose constraints encode the observed data structure. This formulation naturally incorporates outcome predictions from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs), as additional linear constraints that tighten the feasible set. We call these predictions weak shadow variables: they satisfy a conditional independence assumption with respect to missingness but need not meet the completeness conditions required by classical shadow-variable methods. When predictions are sufficiently informative, the bounds collapse to a point, recovering standard identification as a special case. In finite samples, to provide valid coverage of the identified set, we propose a set-expansion estimator that achieves slower-than-$\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rate in the set-identified regime and the standard $\\sqrt{n}$ rate under point identification. In simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on customer-service dialogues, we find that LLM predictions are often ill-conditioned for classical shadow-variable methods yet remain highly effective in our framework. They shrink identification intervals by 75--83\\% while maintaining valid coverage under realistic MNAR mechanisms."}

A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics."}

Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency."}

This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products."}

By decomposing higher-order effects into time-dependent and time-independent components, SurvFD offers a previously unrecognized perspective on survival explanations, explicitly characterizing when and why additive explanations fail. Building on this theoretical decomposition, we propose SurvSHAP-IQ, which extends Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions, providing a practical estimator for higher-order, time-dependent interactions. Together, SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ establish an interaction- and time-aware interpretability approach for survival modeling, with broad applicability across time-to-event prediction tasks."}

Recursively training on such data has been observed to significantly degrade performance in a wide range of tasks, often characterized by a progressive drift away from the target distribution.

For a realistic pipeline where each training round uses a combination of synthetic data and fresh samples from the target distribution, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the accumulated divergence between the generated and target distributions. This allows us to characterize different regimes of drift, depending on the score estimation error and the proportion of fresh data used in each generation. We also provide empirical results on synthetic data and images to illustrate the theory."}

Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers."}
