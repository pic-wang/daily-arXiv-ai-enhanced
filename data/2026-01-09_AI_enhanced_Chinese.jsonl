We propose roofs, a Python package available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/compo/roofs, designed to help researchers in the choice of FS method adapted to their problem. Roofs benchmarks multiple FS methods on the user's data and generates reports that summarize a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including downstream predictive performance estimated using optimism correction, stability, reliability of individual features, and true positive and false positive rates assessed on semi-synthetic data with a simulated outcome. We demonstrate the utility of roofs on data from the PIONeeR clinical trial, aimed at identifying predictors of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. The PIONeeR dataset contained 374 multi-source blood and tumor biomarkers from 435 patients. A reduced subset of 214 features was obtained through iterative variance inflation factor pre-filtering. Of the 34 FS methods gathered in roofs, we evaluated 23 in combination with 11 classifiers (253 models in total) and identified a filter based on the union of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted p-values from t-test and logistic regression as the optimal approach, outperforming other methods including the widely used LASSO.

Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning.

Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks.

In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances.

Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians.

Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

RLV$^\\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?\n  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time (\"rate, not fate\"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning.

Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection. Overall, our findings highlight the promise of embedding-based models for extending learning analytics by enabling scalable detection of SSRL behaviors, ultimately supporting real-time feedback and adaptive scaffolding in collaborative learning environments that teachers value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5171\u7ba1\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSRL\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u60c5\u5883\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e2a\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u60c5\u5883\u4e2dSSRL\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6458\u8981\uff1b\u5c06\u6458\u8981\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6587\u672c-only\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u4e30\u5bcc\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e5\u5fd7\u6d3e\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4bSSRL\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eSSRL\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6267\u884c/\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u79bb\u9898\u3001\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e2e\u52a9\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff1b\u60c5\u5883\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5982\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u7b49\u6784\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u6269\u5927SSRL\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5f97\u5230\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002"}}

Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that character counts are represented on low-dimensional curved manifolds discretized by sparse feature families, analogous to biological place cells. Accurate predictions emerge from a sequence of geometric transformations: token lengths are accumulated into character count manifolds, attention heads twist these manifolds to estimate distance to the line boundary, and the decision to break the line is enabled by arranging estimates orthogonally to create a linear decision boundary. We validate our findings through causal interventions and discover visual illusions--character sequences that hijack the counting mechanism.

While recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate aesthetically appealing images, their reliability in generating infographics remains unclear. Generated infographics may appear correct at first glance but contain easily overlooked issues, such as distorted data encoding or incorrect textual content. We present IGENBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating the reliability of text-to-infographic generation, comprising 600 curated test cases spanning 30 infographic types. We design an automated evaluation framework that decomposes reliability verification into atomic yes/no questions based on a taxonomy of 10 question types. We employ multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to verify each question, yielding question-level accuracy (Q-ACC) and infographic-level accuracy (I-ACC). We comprehensively evaluate 10 state-of-the-art T2I models on IGENBENCH.

Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u6548\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u533a\u57df\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565TAMP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Lyapunov\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6bcf\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5728\u6743\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u533a\u57df\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd/\u7b97\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06AoI\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9010\u65f6\u9699\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTAMP\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728RCooper\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8def\u53e3\u548c\u8d70\u5eca\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cTAMP\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347AP\u9ad8\u8fbe27%\u3002", "conclusion": "TAMP\u53ef\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5185\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u533a\u57df\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FENCE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6269\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6765\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u805a\u7c7b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff09\u5206\u914d\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u8282\u70b9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6613\u504f\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u6b21\u4f18\u63d2\u8865\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFENCE\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u540e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u8fd1\u4f3c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6309\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u7ec4\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u5c42\u9762\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFENCE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6269\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions.

While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting.

Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning. Overall, our study formalizes the learning dynamics of RL post-training and motivates further analysis and improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times.\n  The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination.\n  Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone.\n  This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training.

We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%.

While machine learning (ML) has been used to support electrospinning process optimisation, most existing approaches predict only mean fibre diameters, neglecting the full diameter distribution that governs scaffold performance. This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.\n  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.\n  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions.

In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers. Finally, we validate learnable multipliers with both Adam and Muon optimizers, where it shows improvement in downstream evaluations matching the improvement of the switching from Adam to Muon.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF.

For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling.
