We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.", "AI": {"tldr": "Continuous Flow Operator (CFO) learns the PDE right-hand side via flow matching on temporal splines, enabling time-continuous, time-resilient surrogates with data-efficient training.", "motivation": "Autoregressive neural operators accumulate error and rely on uniform time steps; need a time-continuous surrogate that can handle irregular sampling and arbitrary temporal queries without backprop through solvers.", "method": "Fit temporal splines to trajectory data and estimate time derivatives at knots with finite differences to construct velocity paths; train a neural operator via flow matching to predict these velocity fields; inference uses numerical ODE integration, bypassing backprop through solvers.", "result": "CFO achieves superior long-horizon stability and data efficiency across Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, and 2D shallow water benchmarks; with only 25% irregularly subsampled time points, it outperforms autoregressive models trained on full data (up to 87% relative error reduction); competitive efficiency despite requiring integration, and unique capabilities for reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.", "conclusion": "CFO provides a time-resolution invariant PDE surrogate that avoids backprop through ODE solvers, improves data efficiency and long-horizon stability, and enables flexible temporal querying; potential future work includes exploring scalability, different spline choices, and extending to more complex PDEs."}}

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies.

We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel.

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead.

This is especially important for applications such as structure discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u91cf\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1a\u5728\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9T=O(log N)\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u52a8\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u5f88\u5c0f\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f/\u5bc6\u96c6\u77e9\u9635\u5747\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60N\u7ef4\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u91cf\u6cd5\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u79f0\u52a8\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e3aT=O(log N)\u65f6\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728T=O(log N)\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u52a8\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u5f88\u5c0f\uff1b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u5bf9\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u77e9\u91cf\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u79f0\u52a8\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u3002"}}

Though appealing for financial and logistical reasons, using standard tools for inference can misrepresent the association between independent variables and the outcome of interest when the true, unobserved outcome is replaced by a predicted value. In this paper, we characterize the statistical challenges inherent to drawing inference with predicted data (IPD) and show that high predictive accuracy does not guarantee valid downstream inference. We show that all such failures reduce to statistical notions of (i) bias, when predictions systematically shift the estimand or distort relationships among variables, and (ii) variance, when uncertainty from the prediction model and the intrinsic variability of the true data are ignored. We then review recent methods for conducting IPD and discuss how this framework is deeply rooted in classical statistical theory. We then comment on some open questions and interesting avenues for future work in this area, and end with some comments on how to use predicted data in scientific studies that is both transparent and statistically principled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5c31\u4e00\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6b20\u7f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u56de\u987eIPD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u8feb\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\u6838\u5fc3\u7edf\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff09\u3002\u5e76\u5bf9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684IPD\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u65ad\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684IPD\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u7406\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8ba8\u8bba\u82e5\u5e72\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ee5\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684IPD\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5357\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions. Finally, a practical k-means style optimisation algorithm is introduced and analysed.

We introduce two methods. cps-gp adapts conformal predictive systems to GP interpolation using standardized leave-one-out residuals, yielding stepwise predictive distributions with finite-sample marginal calibration. bcr-gp retains the GP posterior mean and replaces the Gaussian residual by a generalized normal model fitted to cross-validated standardized residuals. A Bayesian selection rule-based either on a posterior upper quantile of the variance for conservative prediction or on a cross-posterior Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion for probabilistic calibration-controls dispersion and tail behavior while producing smooth predictive distributions suitable for sequential design. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions compare cps-gp, bcr-gp, Jackknife+ for GPs, and the full conformal Gaussian process, using calibration metrics (coverage, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, integral absolute error) and accuracy or sharpness through the scaled continuous ranked probability score.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdGP\u63d2\u503c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1acps-gp\u548cbcr-gp\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1-\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u4e0eJackknife+\u53ca\u5168 conformal GP\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d2\u503c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "method": "cps-gp\uff1a\u5c06 conformal\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u9020\u4e3aGP\u63d2\u503c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u7559\u4e00\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u3002bcr-gp\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559GP\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u6b63\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6216\u57fa\u4e8eKS\u7684\u8de8\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u9a8c\uff09\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u6563\u4e0e\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u5149\u6ed1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u62ec cps-gp\u3001bcr-gp\u3001GP\u7684 Jackknife+\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 conformal GP\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001KS\u3001\u79ef\u5206\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\u6821\u51c6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7b49\u7ea7\u5206\u6570\uff08CRPS\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027/\u950b\u5229\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5728\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u5c3e\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aGP\u63d2\u503c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff1bcps-gp\u5177\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0cbcr-gp\u63d0\u4f9b\u5149\u6ed1\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods traditionally rely on global kernel regressors, it is also common to use a smoothness-based approach that exploits local approximations. We show that these perspectives are deeply connected through the spectral properties of isotropic kernels. In particular, we characterize the Fourier spectra of the Mat\u00e9rn, square-exponential, rational-quadratic, $\u03b3$-exponential, piecewise-polynomial, and Dirichlet kernels, and show that the decay rate determines asymptotic regret from both viewpoints. For kernelized bandit algorithms, spectral decay yields upper bounds on the maximum information gain, governing worst-case regret, while for smoothness-based methods, the same decay rates establish H\u00f6lder space embeddings and Besov space norm-equivalences, enabling local continuity analysis. These connections show that kernel-based and locally adaptive algorithms can be analyzed within a unified framework. This allows us to derive explicit regret bounds for each kernel family, obtaining novel results in several cases and providing improved analysis for others. Furthermore, we analyze LP-GP-UCB, an algorithm that combines both approaches, augmenting global Gaussian process surrogates with local polynomial estimators.

Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient unlearning framework that reduces the size of datasets before unlearning leading to significant computational savings (up to approximately 50 percent) on real world empirical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u201c\u5fd8\u8bb0/\u6e05\u9664\u201d\u524d\u5148\u5254\u9664\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e unlearning \u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08\u7ea650%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u67d0\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5fd8\u8bb0\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f4e\u6548\u3002\u82e5\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u5f31\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4fbf\u53ef\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e4b\u524d\u5148\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f29\u5c0f\u5f85\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea650%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5fd8\u8bb0\uff08\u53ea\u5220\u9664\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff09\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347 unlearning \u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "FCNv2 \u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6301\u7eed\u504f\u4f4e\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc5\u901f\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u6240\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u98d3\u98ce\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8 ERA5 \u521d\u59cb\u573a\uff08\u4ee5\u98d3\u98ce Florence\uff0c2018-09-13\u81f316\u65e5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u542f\u52a8 FCNv2\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5bf9\u8352\u8bde\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u98d3\u98ce\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u65e0\u8bba\u4f55\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u4f4e\u4f30\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6570\u6b65\u540e\u53d8\u5f97\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8f93\u51fa\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u4fbf\u4e8e\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u5bf9\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6539\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u7b5b\u9009\u7a00\u758f\u7684 token \u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c0f\u6587\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u80cc\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e0\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ca MIMIC-III \u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCATR \u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8fdd\u80cc\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ca\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u81a8\u80c0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u4e22\u5931\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc6\u522b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981 token \u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\uff08unconfoundedness\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u4e22\u5f03\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6b63\u6027\u8fdd\u80cc\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u7eed\u56e0\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684 MIMIC-III \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCATR \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CATR \u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7126\u5fc5\u8981\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u51cf\u5c0f\u6587\u672c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one.

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map.

Cullen", "Feng Liu", "Sarah M. Erfani"], "title": "On the Bayes Inconsistency of Disagreement Discrepancy Surrogates", "comment": "37 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Deep neural networks often fail when deployed in real-world contexts due to distribution shift, a critical barrier to building safe and reliable systems. An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy.

However, the learning objectives and update dynamics of the Actor and Critic differ, raising concerns about whether uniform transition usage is optimal.\n  Objectives: We aim to improve the performance of deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms by decoupling the transition batches used to train the Actor and the Critic. Our goal is to design an experience replay mechanism that provides appropriate learning signals to each component by using separate, tailored batches.\n  Methods: We introduce Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay (DPER), a novel approach that allows independent sampling of transition batches for the Actor and the Critic. DPER can be integrated into any off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm that operates in continuous control domains. We combine DPER with the state-of-the-art Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm and evaluate its performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.\n  Results: DPER outperforms conventional experience replay strategies such as vanilla experience replay and prioritized experience replay in multiple MuJoCo tasks from the OpenAI Gym suite.\n  Conclusions: Our findings show that decoupling experience replay for Actor and Critic networks can enhance training dynamics and final policy quality.

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG.

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models.

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting. Therefore, IdealTSF is particularly well-suited for applications with noisy samples or low-quality data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively.

Two molecular datasets are considered: the simplistic linear shaped LiH-molecule and the trigonal pyramidal molecule NH3. Both accuracy and generalizability metrics are considered.

The comparative performance of Quantum Machine Learning models with no symmetry equivariance, rotational and permutational equivariance, and graph embedded permutational equivariance is investigated.

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCDEC\u4e0eIDEC\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u8bc1 credal \u96c6\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d85\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u5728MNIST/CIFAR\u53ca\u5176 OoD \u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684 OoD \u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u6210\u5373\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u5929\u751f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u660e\u786e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406 epistemic \u4e0e aleatoric \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aCredal Deep Evidential Classification (CDEC) \u4e0e Interval Deep Evidential Classification (IDEC)\u3002\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u95ed\u5408\u4e14\u51f8\u7684\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u5408\uff08\u8bc1 Credal \u96c6\uff09\u548c evidential \u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u5408\u53ca\u5176\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u62d2\u7edd\u6216\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff08 epistemic/aleatoric\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10 \u4e0e CIFAR-100 \u53ca\u5176\u81ea\u7136 OoD \u53d8\u4f53\uff08F-MNIST\u3001K-MNIST\u3001SVHN\u3001Intel\u3001TinyImageNet\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cCDEC \u4e0e IDEC \u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5728 epistemic \u4e0e\u603b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5148\u8fdb OoD \u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u95f4\uff1b\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u663e\u793a CDEC \u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CDEC \u4e0e IDEC \u5c06\u8bc1\u636e\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The superiority of $\\mathcal{IDK}$-$\\mathcal{S}$ is attributed to two key innovations. First, it inherits the strengths of the Isolation Distributional Kernel, an offline detector that has demonstrated significant performance advantages over foundational methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor due to the use of a data-dependent kernel.

Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process.

First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets.

The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMARS\u7684\u672c\u5730\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408N-ball\u91c7\u6837\u66ff\u4ee3LIME\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5bf93\u4e2aUCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668/\u6838\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u964d\u4f4e37%\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u4fdd\u771f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LIME\u7b49\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5728LIME\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165MARS\u6765\u62df\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528N-ball\u91c7\u6837\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3LIME\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u518d\u52a0\u6743\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2aUCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6838\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e baselines \u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea637%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06MARS\u548cN-ball\u91c7\u6837\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4fdd\u771f\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $\u03bc$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u7ea7\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u03bcP\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\u8fdb\u884c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6/\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5bf9\u6bd4 AdamW \u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c4f\u853d\uff08blocking\uff09\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u5bbd\u5ea6/\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon \u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u968f\u5bbd\u5ea6/\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf blocking\u3001grafting\u3001\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728 190M\u20131.4B \u7684 Llama \u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u03bcP \u7f29\u653e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4f20\u9012\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7 blocking \u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\uff08\u22481/width\uff09\u7f29\u653e\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\uff0cMuon \u4e0e Shampoo \u76f8\u5bf9 AdamW \u7684\u52a0\u901f\u7ea6\u4e3a 1.4\u00d7 \u4e0e 1.3\u00d7\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f20\u9012\uff1b\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u7ea7\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5e94\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8c03\u53c2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU).

Currently, low-code/no-code platforms are widely used to enable end-user development through visual programming, minimizing the need for manual coding. Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and \"copilots\", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development.

In current practice, analog beamforming uses a codebook of pre-configured beams with each of them radiating towards a specific direction, and a beam management function continuously selects \\textit{optimal} beams for moving user equipments (UEs). However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams. This frames the beam selection problem as an online search procedure that locates the moving optimal beam.

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($\u03b1$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope.

This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task.

We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings.

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference.

Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers. We introduce MaxShapley, an efficient algorithm for fair attribution in generative search pipelines that use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
