However, we observe that\ncombining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even\ndegraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical\nincompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined\neffectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually\nsimple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in\ntraining-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through\nconcept inversion.

Generative approaches promise\nfaster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,\nbut are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor\ngeneralisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from\nstructural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building\non this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion\nmodel that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within\nthe binding pocket.

Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can\nbe deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating\nsystem-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the\nbenefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to\nall driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand\nwhether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed\nautonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective\nrationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral\neconomics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when\npursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of\nCR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed\nhuman-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained\namong driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a\nsimple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic\nagents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.\nResults show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates\nthe robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the\nemergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based\non simulation evidence.

However, the generalizability of\nthese label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning\ncapabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate\nthe performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and\nreasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals\ncritical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's\npre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below\nbaseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate\nsufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective\nself-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in\ndetermining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet\neffective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to\nprogressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority\nrollouts during training.

Recent studies have established global\nconvergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence\nin noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the\ntheoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with\nits trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive\nexplicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and\nregression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural\nproperties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the\ntrajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by\nestablishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high\nSNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The\ntrajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM\nestimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle\nbetween the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our\nanalysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on\nstatistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating\nEM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence\nwith arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level.

Existing poisoning attacks\ncompromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of\ngenerated data or require control over the training process, limiting their\napplicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data\npoisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises\nfine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the\ntraining process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate\nstatistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated\noutputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove\nits theoretical feasibility and stealthiness.

Although these approaches result in impressive reductions\nin compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically\nin-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute\ntradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications\nrequire more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency\nand memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that\nartificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent\nstate update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at\nspecific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design\nprocess, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &\nAttend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two\nsimple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of\ntokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression\nresults in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and\nmemory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for\nefficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,\nunlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without\nany retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive\nevaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and\nlong-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing\nefficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different\ncompute-memory budgets.

We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned\nNowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike\nmost deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into\nphysically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion\nand intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a\nlead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable\nadvection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both\nGOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,\nManaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics\nover 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and\nhybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in\nmost settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple\ncities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest\ndegradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model\nproduces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical\nflow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16.
