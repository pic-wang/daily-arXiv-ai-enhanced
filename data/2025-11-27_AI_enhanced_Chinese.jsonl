Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4ee5\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u52a9/bootstrap \u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e Boruta\u3001RFE\u3001Knockoff \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5065\u5168\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u5fc3\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u9608\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u503c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bba\u8bc1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e Boruta \u4e0e Knockoff \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6062\u590d\u8868\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e Boruta \u4e0e Knockoff \u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7 Boruta\u3001RFE\u3001Extra Trees \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7b5b\u9009\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $\u03b5$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $c\u03b5^{-\u03b3}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $\u03b3>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "DNNs\u5be6\u4f5c\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u8a08\u7b97\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8aaa\u660e\uff1a\u900f\u904eHTMC\u51f8\u6027\u8207ResNet\u53c3\u6578\u7bc4\u6578\u7684\u9023\u7d50\uff0c\u5c07 ResNet \u8f49\u5316\u70ba\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u5c0f\u96fb\u8def\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91cb\u5176\u5728\u5404\u7a2e\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91cb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4efb\u52d9\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u8272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u904e\u7d50\u5408\u51fd\u6578\u8907\u96dc\u5ea6\u8207\u795e\u7d93\u7db2\u8def\u53c3\u6578\u7684\u898f\u7bc4\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u500b\u8a08\u7b97Occam's razor \u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u7fa9\u5728 \u03b5-\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0b\u3001\u4ee5\u4e8c\u9032\u5236\u96fb\u8def\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51fd\u6578\u96c6\uff0c\u5728 \u03b3>2 \u7684\u689d\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u51f8\u96c6\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u5b9a\u7fa9 HTMCnorm\uff1b\u5b9a\u7fa9 ResNet \u53c3\u6578\u7684\u52a0\u6b0a L1 \u7bc4\u6578\u4ee5\u8a98\u5c0e\u51fd\u6578\u7684 ResNetnorm\uff1b\u7d66\u51fa HTMCnorm \u8207 ResNetnorm \u7684\u5e7e\u4e4e\u5339\u914d\u7684 sandwich bound\uff0c\u4e26\u8aaa\u660e:minimizing ResNetnorm \u7b49\u50f9\u65bc\u5c0b\u627e\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u5c0f\u7bc0\u9ede\u7684\u96fb\u8def\u3002", "result": "HTMCnorm \u8207 ResNetnorm \u4e4b\u9593\u5b58\u5728\u5e7e\u4e4e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u754c\uff08sandwich bound\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6700\u5c0f\u5316 ResNetnorm \u63a5\u8fd1\u5c0b\u627e\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c11\u7bc0\u9ede\u7684\u96fb\u8def\uff1b\u9019\u4f7f ResNet \u6210\u70ba\u4ee5HTMC\u6a5f\u5236\u8a08\u7b97\u5be6\u6578\u51fd\u6578\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ResNet \u53ca\u5176\u53c3\u6578\u898f\u7bc4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u7406\u8ad6\u6a4b\u6881\uff0c\u4f7f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u88ab\u8996\u70ba\u5c0d\u6297\u904e\u65bc\u8907\u96dc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u7a2e\u8a08\u7b97\u6027Occam's razor\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5728 HTMC \u7684\u51f8\u6027\u5340\u9593\u3002"}}

We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.\n  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients.

However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude.

Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation.

In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT.

A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses.

RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling.

An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification.

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings.

Code available at https://github.com/DJ-Fear/walrus_steering", "summary": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u628a\u673a\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4eff\u771f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u56de\u7b54\u201c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00/\u89c6\u89c9\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff1f\u201d\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406 regime \u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u79cd regime \u95f4\u7684 delta \u5f20\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u5411\u6ce8\u5165\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u64cd\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6ce8\u5165\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u5411\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u88ab\u5b9a\u5411\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u6216\u53bb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u8868\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u793a\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u52a8 AI \u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation.

To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction.

The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias.

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter \u03c3. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness).

In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($\u0394t\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$\u0394t$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $\u0394t$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($\u0394t = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type.

This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals.

We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments.

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning.

To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques.

We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle.

We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%.
